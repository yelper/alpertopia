1. Divide the cleaned and trimmed green beans between 2 quart-sized mason jars. Stack them vertically as best as you can. Don’t be afraid to pack them tightly.
2. Place 2 garlic cloves in each jar, ¼ teaspoon of red pepper flakes in each jar, and divide the dill sprigs between the jars evenly, too.
3. In a small sauce pan, bring the water, vinegar, and kosher salt to a gentle boil. Whisk very well to dissolve salt.
4. When the mixture is boiling, turn the heat off, and carefully pour it into each jar.
5. Tap the jars on the counter a few times, place lids on the jars, and place them in the fridge. You can taste a bean after a few days to see how crisp they are, but they’re best at 7-10 days. Enjoy within 2 weeks.
