1. Cook ramen according to package directions, drain, and set aside. Meanwhile in a heavy, deep pot combine the sesame oil, garlic, and shallot over medium heat. Cook, stirring often, till softened - about 2 minutes. Add sliced mushrooms and Â½ teaspoon kosher salt and cook till softened, another 3-4 minutes. Stir in coconut aminos. Pour in the vegetable broth and bring everything to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer for about 5 minutes. Off the heat, stir in the tahini until mixed through and creamy. Taste and adjust any seasonings (add salt or some sriracha for spice).
2. Separate the noodles into two bowls and pour the mushroom broth over them. Top with sliced green onions and sriracha/sesame seeds as desired. See the post for more topping additions!
