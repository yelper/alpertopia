1. Heat a cast iron skillet on medium-high, add the okra and toss briefly until the okra gains some char. Remove from the skillet and set aside.
2. In the same skillet, add 1 tbsp olive oil if needed, and saute the sliced onions on medium-high heat. Add the garlic and toss briefly.
3. Return the okra to the skillet and stir in the spices. Add the diced tomato, 1/2 cup water, and lime juice. Stir to combine.
4. Lower the heat to medium-low and cover. Cook for 15 more minutes.
5. Garnish with dried mint flakes and toasted pine nuts. Serve hot or warm with rice or pita bread. Enjoy!
