1. Preheat the oven to 425° F, with racks in the middle and top areas of the oven. Grease 12 muffin
cups or fit with paper liners.
2. Coarsely grate the zucchini then toss in a bowl with 1⁄4 teaspoon salt. Let stand for about 10
minutes (which is what it takes me to get everything else going for the recipe). Grab by the fist full
and squeeze over the sink or a bowl to extract the liquid.
3. Cut the blackberries widthwise in half or, if extra large, into thirds. Toss them with 1 tablespoon
of the coarse sugar in a small bowl.
4. Whisk together the oil, brown sugar, eggs, yogurt, molasses, and vanilla until smooth, then stir in
the squeezed zucchini. Whisk in the baking powder, remaining 1⁄2 teaspoon salt, baking soda, and
nutmeg until well incorporated, and then add the flour, folding just until combined.
5. Divide 2 tablespoons of batter into each of the muffin cups (a 2-tablespoon spring-loaded cookie
scoop works great for this). Tap the pan a few times to even out the batter. Sprinkle half of
blackberries into the cups — about 3 pieces each — then top the muffins with the remaining batter,
again about 2 tablespoons, followed by the remaining blackberries. Sprinkle the tops with the coarse
sugar, a heaping 1⁄2 teaspoon per muffin.
6. Bake for 12 minutes in the middle of the oven, then rotate the pan and move to the top rack to
bake for 5 to 7 minutes more, until browned, domed, and set in the centers. Allow to cool in the pan
for about 10 minutes, then gently transfer to a cooling rack, using a mini offset spatula or thin knife,
to cool a bit further before eating.
Storage: These are best eaten within a day or two of being made, and stored loosely covered rather
than in an airtight container. You can also freeze them, once cooled, in an airtight container or bag,
and allow to thaw at room temperature. They’re excellent lightly toasted or griddled.
