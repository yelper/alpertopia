1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.
2. In a small sauce pan over medium-low heat, bring the soy sauce, honey, water, ginger and garlic to a simmer. Transfer to a bowl, add the scallions, and stir to combine. Set aside to cool briefly.
3. Place the salmon skin side down in a baking pan. Pour the sauce over the fish and bake for 13 minutes or until just cooked through, basting every five minutes. Sprinkle with sesame seeds.
