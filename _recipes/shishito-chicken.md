1. Heat 1 tbsp of avocado oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Once the pan is hot, add the shishito peppers in a single layer. Cook stirring for 5 minutes, until all sides are blistered. Turn off heat and remove the peppers from the skillet on to plate. Sprinkle with sea salt and set aside.
2. Cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces and toss evenly with tapioca starch and sea salt. Heat the remaining 3 tbsp of avocado oil in the same skillet over medium heat. Once the pan is hot, add the chicken in a single layer without touching each other (you may need to do this in 2 batches). Fry for 3 minutes on each side until the outer layer is golden and crispy.
3. Remove the chicken and place the pieces on a paper towel-lined plate. In the same skillet, add garlic, ginger, and crushed red peppers and cook for 1 minute. Add coconut aminos, water, and fish sauce, and stir until combined and simmering. Scrape the bottom of the skillet and simmer for 3-4 minutes, until the sauce is thickened. Add chicken and shishito peppers back into the skillet, and toss with the sauce for 1 minute to coat. Remove from heat and sprinkle with sesame seeds, before serving.
