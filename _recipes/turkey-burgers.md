1. For the sauce: In a bowl, combine the yogurt, cucumber, garlic, lemon juice and hot sauce. Season with salt, pepper and additional hot sauce if desired.

2. For the burgers: In a bowl, combin the olives, scallions, garlic and mint. Add the yogurt and feta and salt and stir to combine. Add the turkey and stir gently to combine. Form into 6 or 7 patties.

3. In a large, preferably nonstick, skillet over medium heat, add the oil. Cook the burgers for 5 to 7 minutes per side, or until the turkey is cooked through and the tops and bottoms are golden brown and lightly crusted. If the burgers are very thick, cover the skillet for the last 3 minutes of cooking. Serve on whole wheat buns or pitas with a dollop of sauce.
