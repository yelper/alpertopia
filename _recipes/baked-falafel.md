The night before making falafel, in a large bowl, combine the dried chickpeas with enough water to cover by 3 inches. Cover the bowl and soak for at least 8 hours or overnight. Drain.
Preheat the oven to 375 and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
In a high-speed blender, combine the soaked chickpeas, parsley, cilantro, onion, garlic, flour, cumin, coriander, baking powder, and lemon juice. Pulse until all ingredients are well combined but not smooth; it should have the consistency of sand but stick together when pressed.
Using a cookie scoop or two spoons, divide the falafel mixture into 20 balls and place them on the prepared baking sheet. Lightly flatten each ball using the bottom of a measuring cup. This will help them cook more evenly.
Bake for 15 minutes, flip, bake for 10-15 minutes more until lightly browned.
Add cucumber, tomato and cashew sour cream (1 C cashews, ½ C boiling water for 15 minutes, 1 T lemon juice, 3/4 teaspoon apple cider vinegar, 1 teaspoon nutritional yeast)
