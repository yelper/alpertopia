1. For the syrup, take water, sugar and lemon slice in a saucepan and boil over high heat until the sugar dissolves. Decrease the heat and simmer it for 20 minutes, Take the lemon slice out of the syrup, turn the heat off and leave it to cool on one side.
2. Start making the dough immediately, For this, mix butter, eggs, yogurt, sugar, oil, semolina and baking powder in a bowl, Add the flour gradually, checking the consistency of the dough and start kneading, Add the flour little by little and knead until you get a soft dough that does not stick to the hand,
3. Divide the dough into two parts, Put one of the pieces between two pieces of greaseproof paper and roll it out very thinly with a rolling pin. Make round shapes with a round cookie cutter or a water glass,
4. Line up the four circles halfway on top of each other and wrap them in the form of a roll from the edge you started to line up. Cut it in half right down the middle, Place on the baking tray with the rose-shaped part facing up (you don't need to oil it or place a parchment paper), Prepare the remaining dough the same way,
5. Put one whole pistachio in the middle of each, Bake them in a preheated oven at 190 degrees until golden brown. Remove from oven and pour the cooled syrup over it, Cover it with a tray and let it sit until it absorbs the syrup (I recommend it to wait at least one night). You can serve it the next day by sprinkling rose petals on top.
