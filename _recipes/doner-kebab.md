1. To marinate the meat, put 1 onion into the food processor and make a puree. Mix 500 gr of ground meat in a bowl and add the onion juice to the meat. You can use a sieve to take out the onion juice. Now we are going to add 2 tablespoons of milk, 2 tablespoons of yogurt, 10-12 springs of fresh thyme, half tablespoon red pepper flakes, a pinch of black pepper and half tablespoon of salt to the meat. Give it a good mix and knead for 30 seconds until the mixture is get homogeneous. Wrap the mixture with baking paper and squeeze from both endings. Rest the mixture in the fridge for a day and then put it in the freezer and wait at least for 2 days to make it hard enough to be able to slice thinly. You can keep it in the freezer for 6 months and use whenever you want.  When decide to cook, take out from the freezer and unwrap the doner. Slice as thin as possible and watch your hands! Because doner is frozen it is going to be slippery. If you don’t want to use the all doner you can slice as much as you want then you can put the rest back to the freezer but you have to be quick. If doner melts you can’t freeze it again.
2. After slicing, put half tablespoon of butter to the pan and melt. Place the doner slices to the hot pan and cook both sides until they have thin brown crisp on the edges. Don’t try to flip before cooked enough, otherwise they can fall apart.
3. To make red sauce, mix 2 tablespoons of labneh or yogurt and a 1 tablespoon of hot pepper paste. Add a teaspoon of vinegar, a pinch of red pepper flakes and a pinch of salt. Last but not least, add a teaspoon of ginger puree. You won’t believe how pepper paste and ginger make an amazing mixture together.
4. For making coban (or shepherd) salad, mix 1 diced tomato, 1 diced cucumber, 1 thinly sliced thin green pepper, 6-8 springs of chopped parsley, half lemon juice, 2 tablespoons of olive oil and salt to taste in a bowl.
5. To make onion sumac salad; in a bowl add 1 thinly sliced onion. Slice onions as semi-circles. Add 6-8 springs of chopped parsley, 1 teaspoon of sumac, salt to taste and 2 tablespoons of olive oil and mix them.
6. Cut your bread in half and put the doner in bottom half. Put onion sumac salad, tomatoes and pickles. Press the top half to the pan that you cooked the doner. So it can soak up all the buttery flavors. Close it and take a bite. Bon appetite! Afiyet olsun!
