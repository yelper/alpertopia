1. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, sauté the onion, garlic, bell pepper, and jalapeño
pepper for about 3 minutes, until soft but not browned. Add water, 1 tablespoon at a time, to
prevent burning. Add the bay leaves and sauté for 30 seconds.
2. Add 2 tablespoons of tomato paste. Cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly. If you want a
thicker sauce, add 1 more tablespoon of tomato paste.
3. Stir in the paprika, cumin, chili powder, and pepper. Cook for 1 minute. Carefully pour in
the tomatoes with their juices. Cover the skillet and turn the heat to low. Cook for 10 minutes,
stirring occasionally.
4. Remove from the heat and discard the bay leaves. Stir in the cilantro, chickpeas, and olives.
