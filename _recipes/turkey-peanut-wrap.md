1. Mix together the ingredients for the sauce in a small bowl.  I recommend adding the lite soy sauce last so you can season it “just right” for your tastebuds.  Remember, if you’re using leftover turkey from Thanksgiving, you may get some of the flavor from that too so be careful about over seasoning. Adjust the level of lime, sriracha and soy sauce to your liking.  Set aside.
2. In a large bowl, toss the turkey, broccoli slaw and bell pepper together.  Add the creamy sauce and mix it up using a spatula.  Toss in chopped peanuts, and fold in freshly chopped cilantro and green onions if desired.
3. Stuff in a whole wheat pita OR enjoy over a bed of chopped lettuce for a low-carbohydrate meal.
