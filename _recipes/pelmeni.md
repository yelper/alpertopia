1. Pelmeni Dough
Sift the flour with salt into a mixing bowl. Add eggs, mix the dough for a short bit, then add water to the dough.
Combine everything into a smooth texture by hand or using a Kitchen Aid mixer. Flour the working surface.

Pelmeni Filling
Combine together ground meat, grated onion, salt and pepper.


2. To Assemble Pelmeni
To save time use a mold to make Pelmeni. Roll out a flat piece of dough and place it on a floured mold that’s covered with flour. Fill each hole with meat.
Make one more flat, round piece of dough and place it on top. Sprinkle with flour and roll over it with a roller until each piece is separated.
Flip the mold over and shake out the Pelmeni. Dust them with flour, either freeze for later or boil them to cook.
To make Pelmeni by hand, roll out the dough and cut out small circles using a cookie cutter. Place meat in the middle and fold over the sides into a half-moon shape, pinching the edges together. Connect the two corners together.

3. To Boil Pelmeni
Bring a large pot of salted water to boil and add Pelmeni. You’ll know they’re ready once you see them float to the top. Take Pelmeni out using a strainer. Drizzle them with butter and serve with a side of sour cream.
