1. Preheat the waffle cone machine to a color setting of around 4. Lightly brush both sides with oil.
2. In a small mixing bowl, beat together egg whites, sugar and vanilla. Add the salt and half of the flour; beat to incorporate. Add the melted butter and remaining flour and beat until smooth.
3. Spoon 2 Tablespoons batter onto the center of a hot cone waffle machine. Close the lid, lock the latch. Bake for 1 minute and 30 seconds. Check for proper color and adjust timing accordingly. (See Tip 1)
4. Carefully remove the waffle from cone waffle machine with a wooden fork onto a clean cloth towel. Use the cloth to help lift and roll the waffle around the cone form, pinching the bottom and holding the cone for about 10 seconds to set its shape.
5. Drop several chocolate chips into the cone, and push down with small dowel to the bottom to seal the bottom of the cone. Cool completely. (See Tip 2)
6. Store in airtight container.
