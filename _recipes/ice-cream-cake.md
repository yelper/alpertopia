1. To make the blueberry sauce, combine the ingredients in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook, stirring often, until the blueberries break down and burst and the mixture thickens, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and pour in a jar or bowl - let it cool completely. You can cover this and store it in the fridge until you use it.
2.  To make the strawberry/raspberry sauce, combine the ingredients in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook, stirring often, until the berries break down and burst and the mixture thickens, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and pour in a jar or bowl - let it cool completely. You can cover this and store it in the fridge until you use it.
3.  Line a 9x13 inch dish or pan with 2 layers of plastic wrap, letting it hang over the edges. This is important and helps you remove the ice cream cake to slice!
4.  Set the ice cream out - you want it to soften enough to be “spreadable.” It should not be liquid, but should be thick and starting to melt like frosting.
5.  Coarsely crush the oreos. You can do this in a resealable bag and crush with your hands or a rolling pin. You can also toss them in your food processor and pulse a few times. You don’t want small crumbs, but larger chunks.
6.  Place the crushed cookies all over the bottom of the pan in the plastic wrap. Spread them evenly to create a crust. Take half of the ice cream and spoon it on top of the cookies. I spoon it all over, then use a large spoon to spread it around. You don’t want to spread it too much and lift all the cookies - but don’t worry, a few cookies will lift! It’s no big deal, the cake will still turn out. Spread half (or a little more) of the strawberry/raspberry (or blueberry!) sauce on top of the ice cream. It doesn’t matter which one.
7.  Stick the cake in the freezer for a minute while you unwrap the ice cream sandwiches. Remove the cake and then stick the sandwiches on top in a single layer. The last two sandwiches will fit if they are cut in half. They should cover the cake completely.
8.  Spread the rest of the ice cream over the sandwiches. Top with half the blueberry sauce (or strawberry, if you used the blueberry first.) Cover the dish in plastic wrap tightly. Place in the freezer and freeze for at least 2 hours or even overnight. You can make this a few days ahead of time too!
9. Remove the cake 20 minutes or so before serving. Melt together the 6 ounces of white chocolate and the coconut oil. I do this in a bowl in the microwave in 30 second increments, stirring after each, until melted. I use the coconut oil so the chocolate firms up at room temp.
10.  Remove the cake from the pan by the plastic wrap overhand. Drizzle the melted chocolate over top. Sprinkle with extra crushed cookies if you wish. I like to serve this with the extra strawberry and blueberry sauces for serving. I also like to do fresh mint or berries. Slice and serve!
