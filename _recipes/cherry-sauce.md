1. Add pitted cherries to large saucepan.
2. Stir in sugar, vanilla, lemon juice and pinch of salt.
3. Bring to boil, reduce to medium heat and simmer for 7-8 minutes until cherries release all their juices.
4. Taste and add more sugar if you like sauce a bit sweeter.
5. In small bowl combine together cornstarch and water.
6. While constantly stirring add cornstarch slurry to cherries and cook for additional 3-4 minutes until sauce starts to thicken.
7. Remove from heat and cool. Sauce keeps well in the refrigerator for several days and also freezes very well.
