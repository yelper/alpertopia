1. To prepare the pasta, fill a large pot with 2 inches (5 cm) of water, enough to fully submerge the pasta, cover, and bring to a boil. Add the rotini, stir and cover to bring back to a boil. Remove the lid and cook to al dente, according to the package directions. Drain and rinse the pasta in cool water.


2. Place a large pan over medium-high heat. Add the avocado oil and frozen corn to the pan and season the corn with a pinch of salt and pepper. Let these cook for 4 to 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned. Transfer the corn to a large mixing bowl to cool.


3. Meanwhile, halve the tomatoes, chop the roasted red peppers, dice the cucumber and avocado, and finely chop the cilantro. Add these into the mixing bowl, along with the red onion, if using.


4. For the dressing, to a food processor or blender, add the mayo, yogurt, red peppers, adobo sauce, lime juice, salt, pepper, garlic powder, cumin and parsley, and blend until smooth. Add the dressing and cooked pasta into the mixing bowl, and gently stir to incorporate the dressing. Top the salad with the sliced scallions, if using.
