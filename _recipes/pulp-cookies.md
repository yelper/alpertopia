1. Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a large baking tray with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.
2. Mix all of the wet ingredients together in a large mixing bowl. Add the dry ingredients and mix everything together well. Stir through the chocolate chips.
3. Put the bowl in the fridge for 15 minutes to firm up a little.
4. Use an ice cream scoop or a 1/4 cup measure to scoop your mixture on to the baking sheet. Leave some room around each cookie as they will spread a bit.
5. Push down on the top of each cookie with a fork to flatten them slightly then bake for 22 to 25 (30?) minutes or until golden around the edges. Cool on a wire rack.
