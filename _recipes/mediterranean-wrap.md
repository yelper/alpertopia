1. In a bowl, mix together the ingredients for the lemon vinaigrette and season to taste with sea salt & pepper.
2. Place all the salad ingredients on a large cutting sheet, and using the longest and sharpest knife you have, begin to chop up the salad to desired thickness.
3. Once the salad is chopped, add it to a mixing bowl then add 1 serving of lemon vinaigrette. Mix the salad together with a spatula, then place some of the contents on whole wheat tortilla. Fold in the sides and tightly roll up the wrap.
4. Enjoy any leftover chopped salad by itself.
