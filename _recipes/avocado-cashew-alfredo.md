1. Grind the drained cashews in a high-speed blender. Add the nutritional yeast, miso, 1t salt and broth and blend until smooth. Add the avocado and lemon and blend until smooth, adding more broth, 1 tablespoon at a time, if the sauce is too thick. Set aside.

2. Steam the zucchini noodles over boiling water until tender, 2 to 4 minutes. Set aside.

3. In a large sauce pan, warm the cashew sauce over low heat, stirring often. Add the noodles and tomatoes. Stir gently until the vegetables are heated through, about 5 minutes. When hot, serve at once, sprinkled with black pepper to taste, the basil and the Nutty Parm.
