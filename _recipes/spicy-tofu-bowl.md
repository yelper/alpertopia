1. Press liquid out of the tofu. Cube tofu and toss (gently) with the cornstarch until coated. Arrange on a baking sheet lined with parchment. Arrange broccoli and peppers on another baking sheet. Drizzle all with olive oil and salt. Roast both pans at 425 degrees for 20-30 minutes, until tofu is slightly crisped and broccoli is roasty and delicious.
2. While the tofu and broccoli are roasting, cook the rice.
3. Also, make the sauce by blending everything in a blender or food processor.
4. Serve tofu and broccoli with rice and a good drizzle of peanut sauce. YUM!
