1. In a sauté pan or skillet over medium-high heat, combine the potatoes, carrots, and ¼ cup of
water. Cover the pan and simmer for about 5 minutes, or until the carrots begin to soften. Top
with the sweet peas. Remove from the heat and keep covered
2. In a high-speed blender, combine the tomatoes with their juices, green chiles, ginger,
and garlic. Puree into a thick sauce. Set aside
3. In a small bowl, whisk together the coriander, cumin, turmeric, onion powder, cayenne pepper,
and 2 tablespoons of water to combine.
4. In an 8-quart pot over medium heat, pour in the spice mixture and cook for 1 minute, stir-
ring. Add more water, 2 tablespoons at a time, if the mixture looks dry. Tempering the spices
by heating brings out a different flavor and is common in Indian recipes.
5. Stir the tomato paste into the tempered spices to combine. Cook for 2 minutes, adding more water as needed.
6. Pour in the pureed tomato sauce, stir well, and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat and cook, partially covered for 10 minutes.
7. Add the coconut cream, the remaining 1/2 cup of water, the garam masala and cilantro. Mix to incorporate the coconut cream. Stir in the cooked potatoes, carrots and peas. Bring to a simmer and serve warm as a rich stew or paired with rice. Serve with chickpeas or baked tofu.
