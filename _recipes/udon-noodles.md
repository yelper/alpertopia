1. Coat the bottom of a large pot with the oil and place it over medium heat.
2. When the oil is hot, add the mushrooms in an even layer. Cook the mushrooms for about 5 minutes, flipping once, until browned.
3. Push the mushrooms to the side of the pot and add the white parts of the scallions, garlic, and ginger. Cook everything for about 1 minute, until very fragrant.
4. Stir in the water and napa cabbage. Bring the water to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer the soup for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms are tender and the cabbage is completely wilted.
5. While the soup simmers, cook the noodles according to their package directions. Drain them into a colander when done.
6. After the soup has simmered for 10 minutes, remove the pot from heat. Ladle a bit of the liquid into a small bowl or container and add the miso paste. Stir to dissolve the miso.
7. Pour the miso mixture into the soup and stir in the soy sauce, sriracha sauce, and sesame oil, followed by the cooked noodles and edamame.
8. Taste-test the soup and adjust any seasonings to your liking.
9. Ladle the soup into bowls and top with the green parts of your scallions and sesame seeds. Serve.
