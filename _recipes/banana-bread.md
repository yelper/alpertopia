1. Preheat the oven to 350Â°F and brush a 9x5-inch loaf pan with a bit of olive oil.
2. In a large bowl, combine the mashed bananas with the sugar, almond milk, olive oil, vanilla, and apple cider vinegar and whisk until combined.
3. In a medium bowl combine the flours, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg.
4. Add the dry ingredients to the bowl with the wet ingredients and stir until just combined, then fold in the walnuts. Pour into the prepared pan and sprinkle with the chopped walnuts and oats.
5. Bake for 42 to 50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean.
