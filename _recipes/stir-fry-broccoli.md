1. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add turkey and stir to break it apart. Sprinkle with garlic powder, salt and pepper, stir. Cook until no longer pink, covering the pan occasionally. Once itâ€™s cooked through, drain the fat and remove the turkey to a plate.
2. Replace the pan on the burner and add the oil. Add the broccoli and onion and cook, covered but stirring often, until crisp-tender, about 4-5 minutes.
3. While the vegetables are cooking, stir together the water, soy sauce, brown sugar, ground ginger and cornstarch in a small bowl or measuring cup.
4. Add the sauce to the cooked vegetables and cook until it boils and thickens (1-2 minutes). Add the ground turkey back to the pan and stir to warm through and coat with sauce.
5. Serve with rice.
