1. Combine gelatin, 1 cup sugar, milk, egg yolks and salt in saucepan. Cook, stirring occasionally, over low heat until gelatin is dissolved and mixture coats a spoon. Remove from heat and cool. Turn cottage cheese into a bowl. Beat the cottage cheese on high speed until creamy and smooth. Fold in gelatin mixture.

2. Add lemon juice, lemon rind and vanilla. Chill mixture until it begins to thicken (about 45 minutes). Beat egg whites until stiff but not dry. Whip cream until stiff. Fold egg whites and whipped cream into gelatin mixture. Pour into crumb- lined pan.

3. Optional: Add 2 tablespoons sugar and 1 teaspoon vanilla to sour cream. Spread over mixture in pan. Chill until firm, preferably overnight.

4. "A birthday favorite! Best chilled overnight.'
