1. Cut onion in half. Grate half of the onion and combine in a measuring cup with oil, vinegar, lemon juice, garlic, mustard, thyme, oregano, salt, and pepper.
2. Cut the other half of the onion into 1 ½-inch squares. Set aside.
3. Place the beef cubes in a large zip-top plastic bag. Pour ½ of the marinade into the bag, seal, and refrigerate. Marinate beef for at least one hour, or up to overnight.
4. Set aside the remaining marinade to use for basting later.
5. When ready to prepare the kabobs, remove beef cubes from the marinade. Discard marinade in the bag.
6. Thread beef and vegetables onto separate skewers (if using wooden skewers, be sure to soak them in water first).
7. Brush vegetable skewers with reserved marinade.
8. Broil kabobs 3 inches from heat for 8 minutes. Turn and broil an additional 8 – 10 minutes, or until done. Keep an eye on the vegetables – the tomatoes tend to cook a bit faster, while the peppers and onions may need an extra minute of cooking time. Just remove each skewer from the broiler (or grill) when cooked to desired tenderness.
9. Alternatively, you can grill the shish kabobs for about 20 minutes, turning regularly.
