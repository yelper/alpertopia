1. Heat your oven to 536 F without fan. If you have a baking stone you can place it to the bottom of your oven.
2. Mix 120 ml warm water, 1 teaspoon of instant yeast and a pinch of sugar in a bowl. Rest for a couple of minutes. Add 200 grams of all-purpose flour, 50 grams of melted butter and a teaspoon of salt. Butter shouldnâ€™t be hot. Just melted is enough. First mix and knead for about 6 minutes until you have a smooth and elastic dough.
3. Cover with a damped kitchen cloth and let it rest 40-45 minutes. After rising take the dough on your counter and make 4 equal balls. Shape each of them as flat and round. 15 cm (6 in) will be great. Place them on a baking paper as pairs and cover again and let it proof for 15 minutes.
4. Sprinkle sesame and black seeds on breads. You can spread some melted butter or egg wash to make stick seeds to dough. After that place them to the bottom of your pan or onto baking stone and bake for 11-13 minutes until they are browned.
