1. Preheat the oven to 425°F. Lightly oil or spray 2 baking sheets with nonstick spray. (I use a standard half sheet pan 18×13). Set aside.
Heat 1 Tbsp. oil in a medium sized skillet over medium heat. Add the ground beef and cook until no longer pink, drain the excess fat.
2. Return to the burner and add in the taco seasoning, water, garlic, lime juice, diced green chiles, salt, and pepper to taste.
3. Cook until most of the moisture has evaporated, stirring occasionally ~5 minutes.
Then stir in 1 cup of shredded cheese and stir until combined. Turn off the burner & remove from heat.
4. Wrap the tortillas in a clean towel or paper towel and microwave for 30 seconds – 1 minute. This helps warm them so they don’t break apart while assembling. Making them more pliable is helpful!
5. Working on one half of the tortilla, spread about ¼ cup of the beef mixture down on the tortilla.
6. Top with a little bit of shredded cheese. Fold the tortilla over to seal. Lightly brush the top of the tortilla with just a little more oil.
7. Repeat with remaining taco filling and tortillas. Careful not to fill them too much because it will ooze out and get messy. I bake about 6 at a time on a baking sheet, you should yield ~8-10 tacos.
8. Bake for 15-20 minutes or until hot and crispy! (no need to flip)
9. While they are baking, you can make the chipotle crema. Blitz everything in a food processor until smooth. Taste and adjust according to your preferences.
10. Serve the tacos with your favorite toppings and the crema.
