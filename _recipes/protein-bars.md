1. Mix all ingredients until well combined. Mixture should be fairly soft and not dry or crumbly. Add a splash of water or milk, or an extra drizzle of honey, if needed.
2. Press very firmly into an 8Ã—8 inch pan. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour before cutting into bars.
3. Store bars in the fridge for up to 2 weeks.
