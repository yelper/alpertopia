1. Garlic Herb Butter: Melt 1 tbsp butter in a medium skillet, add 6 cloves of minced garlic and cook until fragrant. Move the garlic to the medium bowl and add remaining 4 tablespoons of softened butter, fresh herbs, fresh lemon zest and salt. Mix well.
2. Preparing Rolled Turkey: Lay turkey breast, skin side down, and season with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Set aside. Rub garlic herb butter from step 1 all over the underside of turkey and under the skin. Roll the turkey to form a tube and use toothpicks (or fingers:) to hold it tight in place. Using kitchen twine, tie it around the turkey to keep it from opening up during roasting. Rub the remaining herb butter on top of the roll.
3. Roasting Rolled Turkey: Preheat oven to 375 F. Place in a roasting pan or a baking dish and bake until an instant-read thermometer registers 160 degrees to 165 degrees, about 1 hour to 1 hour 15 minutes total. Remove from oven, and let rest for 10 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board, remove twine, and cut crosswise into 1/2- to 1-inch-thick slices. Place slices on a platter, and garnish with parsley.
