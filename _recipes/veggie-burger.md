1. Preheat the oven to 450Â°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper,
2. In a food processor, combine the onion, garlic, sweet potato, and walnuts. Process for 1 to
2 minutes, or until the ingredients are combined and have the consistency of rice.
3. Add the brown rice, cooked lentils, paprika, and tamari. Pulse several times to incorporate the
ingredients.
4. In a large bowl, stir together the tomato paste, water, mustard, and flaxseed. Add the blended
ingredients to the bowl and mix to combine fully
5. Starting with cup, stir in the cornmeal, adding more if the mixture looks too wet. The dough
should form a ball without sticking to your hands too much. Divide the dough into 12
equal portions, roughly 14 cup each. Roll the portions into balls and flatten onto the
prepared baking sheet.
6. Bake for 15 minutes, flip the patties and bake for 15 minutes more. The patties should be browned on the outside and firm to the touch. Serve immediately or let cool completely before freezing.
