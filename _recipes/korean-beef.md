1. In a small bowl, prepare the sauce by whisking together the soy sauce, honey, cornstarch, and red pepper flakes. Set aside.
2. In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat.
3. Add the beef and cook, stirring, until no longer pink, breaking it into crumbles as you cook, about 5 minutes.
4. Drain the beef and return it to the skillet. Add the garlic and ginger and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.
5. Stir the sauce into the beef. Cook for 2 more minutes, until heated through and the sauce thickens.
6. Off heat, drizzle the dish with sesame oil, sprinkle it with sliced green onions, and serve.
