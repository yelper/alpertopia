1. Wash the sugarsnap peas well. Using a knife, trim both ends and remove the tough string that runs along the back of the peas.


2. In a small saucepan, combine the vinegar, honey and sea salt. Heat until the honey and salt are entirely dissolved.
3. Prepare a 24- or 32-ounce mason jar. Place the ginger slices in the bottom. Cut the green onion into 2 or 3 segments, so that they fit the jar. Stand them up in the jar, along with the sprig of mint. Pack the prepared sugarsnaps into the jar. If they donâ€™t all fit, set them aside. You may be able to sneak them in once the pickling liquid is poured.
4. Pour the hot vinegar over the sugarsnaps. Gently tap the jar on the counter to release any air bubbles. If you had any remaining peas, try and pack them into the jar at this time. Place a lid on the jar and let rest at room temperature for 1 hour then transfer to refrigerator.
5. Let the pickles sit in the vinegar at least 24 hours before eating. They will keep up to 1 month in the refrigerator.
