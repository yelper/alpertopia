1. Preheat oven to 450f and set the rack to on the middle level.
2. Trim the leg of lamb interior of any large excess fat pieces. Dry off the lamb with paper towels then spread it out, interior facing up, onto a large cutting board. Drizzle with half of the olive oil. Season the lamb's interior with half of the kosher salt, pepper, and rosemary. Also, add all of the parsley and minced garlic to the interior.
3. Roll the leg of lamb into a cylinder (to ensure even cooking) and tie it tightly. If you know how to tie a butcher's knot, now is the time to do it. Otherwise, tie it every 1-2 inches to secure.
4. Cut small slits into the lamb's exterior and insert the garlic slices. Coat the lamb with the remaining olive oil and season the exterior with the remaining salt, pepper, and rosemary.
5. Place the lamb in a roasting pan elevated with a wire rack. Pour 1 1/2 cups of water into the pan making sure the water doesn’t rise to the bottom of the lamb.
6. Roast the lamb for 15 minutes, then turn the heat down to 350f. Cook the lamb until the center of the lamb achieves 130f for medium-rare after resting. Use an oven-safe digital thermometer or check with an instant-read thermometer during cooking to get the temp just right. The lamb should take about 15-20 minutes per pound to cook.
7. When the lamb is finished roasting, remove it to a cutting board, and let it sit lightly tented with foil for 10-15 minutes. Remove the twine and cut it into slices. Enjoy!
