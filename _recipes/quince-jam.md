Wash, core and cut quince into chunks.
In a stainless or copper pot whisk together water, sugar and lemon juice.
Stir in the chopped quince.
Place pot over medium-high heat and bring to a boil.
Cover the lid of the pot with a towel (to catch the steam), reduce heat to low and simmer until quince changes to a dark, ruby red color, approximately 2-3 hours.
Stir quince every 30 minutes to keep from burning. If low on water, stir in more as needed.
When jam is fork tender and ruby red in color, remove from heat and allow to cool to room temperature.
Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator
