1. Prepare three half pint jars and a small canning pot. Put lids in a small pan of water and bring to a bare simmer.
2. Wash, pit and chop the plums. The yield from the quart should be approximately four cups chopped fruit.
3. Combine chopped fruit and sugar in a large, non-reactive pan. Stir until the fruit begins to release its juice. Turn heat to high and bring to a boil.
4. Boil the jam over high heat for 15-20 minutes, stirring regularly to ensure that it does not burn. Add cinnamon and nutmeg and stir to combine. When jam begins to thicken, use the cold plate test to check for set.
5. When the jam appears to have reached set, remove the pot from the heat. Ladle into prepared jars.
6. Wipe rims, apply lids and rings and process in a boiling water canner for 10 minutes.
7. Remove jars from canner and allow to cool 24 hours on the counter.
