1. Cook Ramen noodles according to the instructions provided, then drain and set aside.
2. Mix well the ingredients for the sauce, then set aside.
3. Set a nonstick wok on medium HIGH heat.  Once hot, add eggplant and ginger, then sear for 1-2 minutes until marks appear along the edges of the eggplant.
4. Reduce the heat to medium, then add oil, green onions and garlic.  Stir in the wok for 2 minutes, then add mushrooms.  Cook for 1 minute.
5. Add bell pepper, carrots and broccoli.  Continue cooking for 1-2 minutes, then move all the food to one side of the wok (as much as possible).
6. Stir the sauce one more time before pouring it into the open side of the wok.  As soon as the sauce begins to simmer, reduce the heat to LOW or OFF, then quickly fold the veggies in the sauce.
7. Fold in the cooked Ramen noodles and continue mixing to ensure everything is coated in the sauce and well mixed.
