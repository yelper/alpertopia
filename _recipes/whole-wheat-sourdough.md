1. Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess. Combine flour with the rest of the ingredients, mixing until a shaggy dough forms.
2. Let the dough rest, covered, for 20 minutes, then knead until fairly smooth and slightly sticky.

3. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover it, and let it rise until almost doubled, about 60 to 90 minutes.

4. Gently fold the dough over a few times on a lightly floured work surface.

5. Shape it into an 8" log, and place it in a lightly greased 9" x 5" loaf pan.

6. Cover the loaf and let it rise until it's crowned 1" over the rim of the pan, about 60 to 90 minutes.

7. Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 350°F

8. Bake the bread for 40 to 45 minutes, or until the loaf is golden brown and a digital thermometer inserted into the center registers 205°F to 210°F.
9. Remove the bread from the oven, let it sit in the pan for 5 minutes, then turn it out onto a rack to cool.
