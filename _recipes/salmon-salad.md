1. Trim and thinly slice the strawberries; place in a medium saucepan, reserving a small handful for garnish.

2. Add vinegar, honey, and Dijon to the saucepan; bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until berries have softened and mixture thickens, 8-10 minutes.

3. Meanwhile, preheat a grill pan or regular skillet over medium-high heat.

4. Pat the salmon dry with paper towels and place on a plate; season with salt and pepper on both sides. Once the grill pan or skillet is hot, coat with oil. Add salmon and cook until opaque, 4-5 minutes per side. Transfer to a clean plate.

5. Add lemon zest, salt, pepper, and water to the saucepan with the strawberries and remove from the heat.

6. Using a hand or regular blender, pur√©e the dressing until smooth, adding additional water, 1 tbsp at a time, to reach drizzling consistency.

7. Cut lemon into wedges and set aside. Roughly chop walnuts. Crumble goat cheese.


8. To serve, divide the spinach between plates. Top with grilled salmon, walnuts, goat cheese, and reserved strawberries. Place lemon wedges on the side and drizzle with dressing. Enjoy!
