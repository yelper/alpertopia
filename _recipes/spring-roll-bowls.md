1. SAUCE PREP: Pulse the sauce ingredients together in a blender or food processor.
2. NOODLE PREP: Cook your rice noodles by soaking them in cold water for about 30 minutes. When theyâ€™re softened, transfer to a pot of boiling water for just a minute or two before quickly draining again. *This is my preferred method because it prevents them from getting overly sticky.*
3. VEG PREP: Mince the herbs, slice the serranos, and peel or julienne cut the vegetables.
4. BOWL PREP: Toss the noodles (hot or cold! your choice, friend) with the sweet garlic lime sauce and all the other ingredients.
