1. Preheat oven to 350°. In a large bowl, whisk together almond flour, coconut flour, baking powder, and salt. Add melted butter and egg and stir until a dough forms. Press dough evenly into a 9” pie plate (all the way up the edges, don’t worry about it being too thin), then use a fork to poke holes all over crust.
2. Bake until lightly golden, 10 minutes.
3. In a large bowl, whisk together pumpkin, cream, brown sugar, eggs, spices, and vanilla until smooth. Pour pumpkin mixture into par-baked crust.
4. Bake until filling is slightly jiggly in the middle and crust is golden, 45 to 50 minutes.
5. Turn off oven and prop door open. Let pie cool in oven for 1 hour, then refrigerate until ready to serve. Serve with whipped cream, if desired.
