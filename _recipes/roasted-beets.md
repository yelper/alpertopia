1. Preheat oven to 350°F. Scrub outside of beets, and then wrap each beet in aluminum foil. Place foil-wrapped beets on a baking sheet, and bake in preheated oven for 50-60 minutes, or until the beets are soft when pierced with a fork.
2. Remove beets from oven and let cool until cool enough to handle—about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the vinegar, honey or maple syrup, salt, and pepper in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until thick and bubbly—about 3 minutes.
3. Using clean hands, rub off the peels of the beets, or alternatively, use a sharp vegetable peeler to peel off the peels. Slice the peeled beets into 1/4" rounds. Layer rounds on a platter, and then drizzle with the glaze before serving. Season with additional salt and pepper, if desired.
