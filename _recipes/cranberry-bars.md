1. Preheat oven to 350°. Mix brown sugar and butter until well combined. Add 2 eggs and mix until well combined. Mix in vanilla and orange extract. Add ginger, salt and baking powder and mix.
Mix in flour by hand until just combined. Add white chocolate chips and dried cranberries and stir until evenly distributed through batter.

2. Spread dough on parchment lined 13x9 cookie sheet. (Don't worry if dough does not quite meet the edges, it will spread during baking). Cook on middle rack of 350° oven for 18-22 minutes, until edges are starting to brown. Don't over bake.  Remove from oven and cool in pan on racks.

3. When the bars are absolutely cool frost with the cream cheese frosting.

4. Using a hand mixer,  mix cream cheese and powdered sugar until well combined. Add orange extract and vanilla and combine. Add melted white chocolate and mix until well combined. Spread over cooled bars. Scatter chopped  cranberries over the top, drizzle with melted chocolate (I use a fork and just flick it on).

5. Refrigerate for at least an hour.

6. Remove and cut into triangles or squares (I use a pizza cutter). Keep refrigerated. They freeze very well.
