1. In a medium bowl, combine all meatball ingredients and mix thoroughly. Form meatballs using a small scoop. Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Place in refrigerator.
2. Heat olive oil over medium heat in a large pot. Add the onions, carrots, celery and garlic and cook, covered until soft, 10 minutes. Add chicken stock, dill, oregano, salt and pepper and bring to a boil, reduce heat to a low boil, and cook uncovered for 10 minutes.
3. Add acini di pepe and continue to cook for 6 minutes until pasta is tender. Drop the meatballs into the soup and continue to cook for 4 minutes, until the meatballs float. Add spinach and parmesan and cook for an additional 2 minutes. Serve immediately.
