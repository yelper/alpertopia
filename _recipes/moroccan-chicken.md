1. In a medium bowl, mix the cumin, ginger, salt, turmeric, paprika, cinnamon, and pepper with 2 T of the olive oil and garlic. Add the chicken and coat it with the mixture. Let the chicken sit for 15 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, in a Dutch oven or large, deep pot, heat the remaining 1 T of olive oil over medium heat. Add the chicken and brown on both sides, about 5 minutes per side.
3. Add the lemon, potatoes, onion, dates, olives, parsley and broth. Stir together. Reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer until the chicken is so tender it falls off the bone and the mixture smells aromatic, about 2.5 hours.  Serve with rice.
