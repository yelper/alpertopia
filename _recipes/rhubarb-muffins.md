1. Preheat oven to 375°F. Line twelve 2½-inch muffin cups with foil liners or use a silicone muffin pan. (See tip, recipe intro.)
2. In a large bowl stir together the first five ingredients (through salt). In a small bowl combine flaxseed meal and ¼ cup water; let stand 5 minutes.
3. In a blender combine flaxseed mixture and the next four ingredients (through vanilla). Cover and blend about 2 minutes or until very smooth. Add to flour mixture; stir just until moistened. Stir in strawberries and rhubarb.
4. Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups. Sprinkle with almonds. Bake 20 to 25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in centers comes out clean. Cool in pan on a wire rack 10 minutes. Transfer muffins to wire rack; cool completely.
