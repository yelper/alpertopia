1. Using a fine mesh strainer, rinse the quinoa.
2. Bring the milk to a boil in a medium sized pot over medium-high heat.
3. Add the quinoa and bring back up to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover with a lid and simmer for 15-20 minutes until most of the milk has been absorbed and the quinoa is tender.
4. Stir in the cinnamon, salt, vanilla and maple syrup until fully combined.
5. Serve with fresh fruit, toasted nuts or coconut flakes, cream, milk or extra syrup for added sweetness.
