1. In a medium saucepan, boil water and sugar until the sugar dissolves. Reduce the heat to simmer, and stir in cranberries, pureed orange, apple, pear, dried fruit, pecans, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Cover, and simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the cranberries burst. Cook below 4 on stove, watch for burning.

2. Remove from heat, and let cool to room temperature. Immersion blend it if you want it smoother.
