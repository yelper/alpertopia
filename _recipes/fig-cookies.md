1. Toast the pecans in a skillet over medium heat for a few minutes until slightly toasty and fragrant. Roughly chop the nuts and add to a medium mixing bowl along with the rolled oats, and a cup of chopped dried fig. Stir together and set aside.
2. In a small mixing bowl, stir together flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and cinnamon until even distributed. Set aside.
3. In a large mixing bowl or in the bowl of your stand mixer, add softened butter and brown sugar, beat with the paddle attachment on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 1-2 minutes. Add egg and vanilla extract, and continue beating until thoroughly combined, another 1 - 2 minutes.
4. Lower the mixer speed to stir and slowly add the flour mixture, mix until just combined. Add the nut, oat and fig mixture and stir until evenly distributed. Give the mixture a final stir with a spatula, scraping the side and bottom of the bowl to ensure even mixing.
5. Use a large ice cream scoop to portion the cookie dough. Place cookie dough on a parchment line baking sheet about 2 inches apart. Refrigerate while the oven is preheating.
6. Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Bake one tray at a time in the middle of the oven for 16 minutes, rotate the baking sheet at the 10 minutes mark.
7. Remove from the oven and allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 - 10 minutes, then remove them to cool completely on a wire rack.
