1. Cut tofu into 1-inch cubes, and place on an ovenproof tray. Toss in Braggs/soy sauce, avocado oil and apple cider vinegar.
2. Place under your oven's broiler (grill) for 10 minutes, or until cubes are just turning golden. Flip and cook for another 10 minutes until cubes are browned but not tough. Remove from oven and set aside.
3. While tofu is cooking.... Cook noodles as per instructions. Then rinse, drain and set aside. Make sauce by mixing almond butter and vinegar together in a small bowl. Add maple syrup and Braggs/soy sauce and mix well until smooth.
4. In a large skillet, heat 1 tsp oil on medium. Add mushroom slices and cook for 3 minutes, stirring frequently. Add bok choi and carrot and cook for another 3 minutes, continuing to stir.
5. Reduce heat and add pre-cooked noodles, tofu and green onions to skillet. Pour over sauce and mix well to combine. Serve in large bowls decorated with cilantro leaves, toasted almond pieces and lime wedges.
