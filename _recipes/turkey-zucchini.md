1. Preheat oven to 400. Line a baking sheet with parchment.
2. In a large skillet, heat 1 T of the olive oil over medium heat. Add the shallots and saute until soft and transparent, 2-3 minutes. Add the ground turkey, mushrooms, herbes de Provence, salt and pepper. Stir together and break up the turkey into smaller bits. Cook until the turkey is browned and the musyhrooms are soft, 5-8 minutes
3. Cut the zucchini in half lengthwise and scoop the seeds and some of the soft flesh out of the middle of each, creating a space for the turkey mixture. Place on the baking sheet and drizzle the remaining 1 T of olive oil over the zucchini, rubbing it into the flesh.
4. Fill the middle of each zucchini boat with the turkey mixture. Top with the chopped tomatoes and cheese. Bake for about 20 minutes until the zucchini is soft and the tops are browned.
