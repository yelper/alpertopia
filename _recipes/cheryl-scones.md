1. In a large bowl, thisk together the dry ingredients and then grate in the butter. Cut it all together with a pastry bnlender or two forks or knives to create a just-crumbly mixture. In a liquid measuring cup whisk together one egg and the heavy cream. Pour this into the crumb mixture and stir until it just comes together. Fold in the cherries until just combined (make sure the cherries are truly as drained and patted dry as you can get them). Preheat your oven to 375 degrees. Line a baking tray with parchment.

2. Break the dough into ~2 1/2" diameter balls and place them on the tray about 2" apart. Flatten them gently into discs about 1 1/2" thick. Place in the freezer until the oven is ready.

3. Whisk the reamining egg with the 1 tbsp water until the egg whites are compeltely broken up. Brush the tops of the scones with the egg wash and then sprinkle with the turbinado sugar. Slide in the oven, middle rack and bake for about 25-30 minutes or until golden on top and golden brown around the edges. Serve warm with tea and copious amounts of real butter (try salted)
