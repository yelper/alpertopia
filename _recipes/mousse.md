1. Melt the chocolate. Cut or break the chocolate into chunks. For the double boiler method, half-fill a small pan with water and bring to a boil. Place a heatproof bowl on top, making sure that the bottom is not touching the water. Add in the chocolate, wait for the chocolate to start melting, then stir, and repeat until all the chocolate has melted. If using the microwave, place the chocolate chunks into a glass bowl and in the microwave at 400 W for 30 seconds. Mix the chocolate and place back for another 30 seconds. Repeat until all the chocolate has melted.
2. Make the mousse. Add the tofu, silken chocolate, maple syrup, water, salt, and cayenne pepper in a blender or a food processor and pulse until equally combined.
3. Prep the toppings. Chop and cut your toppings, such as fruit and nuts, and crumble graham cookies if using them. Shaved chocolate and coconut flakes can also be lovely toppings on this mouse.
4. Assemble. Spoon the mouse into cute little glasses or espresso cups, and add the toppings of your choice. Place in the fridge, if not eating immediately.
