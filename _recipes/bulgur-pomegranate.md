1. Prepare the bulgur: In a large, dry heavy pan over high heat, use tongs to char the onion, celery, carrot, bay leaves and chile until completely burnt, about 6 to 8 minutes. Add 8 cups of water and the salt, and cook until reduced by half, about 25 minutes.
2. Put the bulgur in a large bowl. Strain and pour the hot charred vegetable stock over the bulgur. Stir the bulgur and cover with plastic wrap until all the liquid is absorbed, about 30 minutes. (Drain the bulgur if there is any water left in the bowl.) This will yield about 8 cups bulgur. (You can use extra bulgur for a side dish, toss it into salads, like tabbouleh, or add it to soups.)
3. Meanwhile, make the vinaigrette: Mix the vinegar and shallot in a small bowl and set aside for 10 minutes. Sprinkle with the salt and pepper, then slowly drizzle in the olive oil while whisking until the dressing is emulsified.
4. Assemble the salad: In a large bowl, mix 6 cups of the bulgur, the pomegranate seeds, walnuts, red onion, mint and basil. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Add the vinaigrette and toss until just incorporated, but don’t overmix. Taste and adjust the salt as needed.
5. In a small bowl, stir together the crème fraîche, garlic, chile and dill and spread the mixture on the bottom of a serving platter. Pile the salad on top and finish with a drizzle of pomegranate molasses and a pinch more pepper.
