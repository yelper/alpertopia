1. Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over medium until shimmering. Working in batches if needed, add chicken pieces in a single layer, and cook, undisturbed but turning once halfway through cooking time until golden brown on both sides, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer chicken to a plate. Reserve pan drippings in Dutch oven.
2. Add onion and salt to Dutch oven; cook, stirring often, until onions are translucent, about 4 minutes. Add garlic; cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in bell peppers; cook, stirring occasionally, 2 minutes. Stir in tomatoes; cook, stirring occassionally, until tomatoes are saucy and cooked through, about 5 minutes. Stir in bacon, olives, paprika, thyme, bay leaves, and black pepper. Add the browned chicken; cover and cook over medium-low, stirring sauce occasionally, until a thermometer inserted into thickest portion of chicken reads 165°F and sauce is thickened, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove and discard bay leaves from stew before serving.
