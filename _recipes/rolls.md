1. First, we get the bread ready. Combine first 4 ingredients in the bowl of the mixer and wait 20 minutes. The mixture will become foamy.

2. Then, using the hook attachment for the mixer add the remaining ingredients. Knead for 10 - 15 minutes. Combine. Mixture starts off stuck to the sides. Mixture comes clean from the sides after 10 minutes kneading


3. Allow to rise in the bowl, covered with a cloth, in a draft-free place. (Do not place on oven top, just leave the bowl on your kitchen worktop). About 30 - 45 minutes

4. Once it has doubled, pull off pieces of the dough, slightly smaller than a tennis ball. Pull the dough from the top of the dough ball to the bottom, until nice and smooth on the top. When you come to make balls with the dough, have a bowl of flour close by to dust your hands making it easier to handle. Be generous and make sure your hands are well dusted!

6. Place the rolls apart from each other on a floured tin/tray. Allow to rise again on the cookie sheet, until the dough balls are touching (like in the picture). Rising will take about 30 - 45 minutes

8. Bake at 400 F / 200C / Gas 6 for 20-30 minutes (until golden brown).
