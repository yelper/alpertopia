1. Pat chicken dry and place in a bowl. Add the cornstarch and stir to coat.

2. In a large skilled over medium heat, add the oil. Cook the chicken for 2 to 3 minutes per side, or until just cooked through. Remove the chicken and set aside. Add the onion, bell pepper, and celery and saute for 3 to 5 minutes, or until softened. Add the pineapple, garlic, ginger and red pepper flakes and saute for 1 minute.

3. Meanwhile, in a bowl, combine the reserved pineapple juice, brown sugar, vinegar, ketchup, and soy sauce. Add to the skillet and simmer, stirring to dislodge any bits of food that might have stuck to the bottom of the skillet. Reduce the heat to medium-low, return the chicken and any accumulated juices to the skillet and cook for 1 to 2 minutes or until chicken is heated through and coated with sauce.
