1. Pour the Â¼ cup olive oil into a small saucepan. Stire in the lemon zest and juice, then add the tomatoes, shallot and garlic. Heat the sauce very gently until just warm. Turn off the heat and add the herbs. Season with salt and pepper then leave to infuse 10 minutes.
2. Season the salmon with black pepper to taste. Heat the 1 T of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the salmon, skin side down, and fry 2-3 minutes until the skin is lightly colored.
3. Turn the fillets over and cook 2-3 minutes longer until the fish is cooked through. Pour the herb sauce into the skillet and warm through. Serve the salmon with the sauce spooned over.
