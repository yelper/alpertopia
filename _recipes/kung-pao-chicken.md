1. In a medium bowl, whisk together all the ingredients for the sauce.
2. In a large bowl, season chicken with salt, pepper and drizzle 1 tablespoon of sauce over the chicken. Allow chicken to marinate while you spiralize the zucchini. Use a spiralizer or a vegetable peeler to spiralize zucchini. Pat dry with paper towel.
3. Heat 2 tablespoons of cooking oil in a wok or a large skillet on medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook until brown, about 4-5 minutes. Add in the dried chilies and cook for another minute until fragrant. Pour in the sauce and turn the heat to high, allowing the sauce to bubble and thicken. Add more water, one tablespoon at a time, only as needed to thin out the sauce.
4. If cooking the zucchini noodles, add into the pan and use tongs to toss and coat with sauce. Cook for 1-2 minutes until zucchini is just tender but still firm. Be careful not to overcook.
5. Serve immediately and garnish with green onions and sesame seeds if desired.
