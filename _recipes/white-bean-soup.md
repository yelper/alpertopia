1. In a large pot or saucepan, heat olive over medium high heat. Add onions and cook until onions are translucent, about 3-5 minutes. Add the garlic, carrots, celery, thyme, oregano, salt and pepper, and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes.
2. Add vegetable broth and beans, bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes to combine all of the flavors together.
3. Stir in the spinach and continue to simmer until the spinach wilts, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat, sprinkle fresh parsley and grated parmesan cheese, if desired, and serve immediately.
