1. Make the filling: Step 1In a large heavy bottomed pot over medium-high heat, heat 2 tablespoon oil. Add mushrooms and sear until deeply brown, remove from skillet. Lower heat to medium and add remaining oil. Add onion, celery, parsnips, and butternut squash, cook until starting to become well browned, about 12 minutes.
2. Stir in tomato paste and garlic and cook, stirring often, about 2 minutes. Stir in miso paste, immediately deglaze with wine, and cook 1 minute more. Add the mushrooms back in and stir in the lentils. Sprinkle everything with flour and stir until well incorporated.
3. Cook 1 more minute and then add vegetable stock. Season with salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer and cook until the lentils are al dente, about 15 minutes.
4. For the mashed potatoes and assembly: Preheat oven to 425Â°. In a large pot, cover potatoes with water and season with salt. Bring to a boil and cook until totally soft, 15 to 18 minutes. Drain and return to pot. Use a potato masher to mash potatoes until smooth.
5. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan over medium heat, heat oil and thyme. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, 1 minute. Discard thyme and pour oil over potatoes. Add butter and stir until completely combined and creamy. Season with salt and pepper.
6. Spread evenly over the vegetable filling and bake until there is very little liquid visible and mashed potatoes are golden, about 35 minutes. Broil if desired and garnish with parsley and thyme before serving
