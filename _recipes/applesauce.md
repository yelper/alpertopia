1. Peel and core apples. I use a johhny apple peeler to do all three steps at once (peel, spice and core).
2. Add lemon juice and cinnamon to instant pot and stir to combine. Add apples and toss to mix.
3. Slow cooker for 4 hours
4. Mash the apple mixture a few times with a potato masher, if desired. (If you like a smoother texture you could pulse it in the blender.)
5. Transfer contents to a bowl and allow to cool completely. Stir in more cinnamon, if desired, to taste. Enjoy warm or cold. Store in the fridge for up to 7-10 days.
