1. Defrost the cauliflower overnight in the fridge or a few hours at room temperature.
Preheat the oven to 425°F. Lightly oil a large baking sheet, or line it with parchment paper.
Cut up any larger pieces of cauliflower so that the florets are all roughly the same size for even cooking. Drain the cauliflower and dry it on paper towel or a clean tea towel if necessary, and place on the prepared baking sheet. Toss the cauliflower with the sesame oil and Everything-but-the-Bagel spice.

2. Spread the cauliflower out on the prepared baking sheet, ensuring there's space between each floret so they can crisp on the edges. If they are all together, they will steam and remain soft. Once the oven has preheated completely, place the cauliflower on a middle rack and roast for 25-30 minutes, tossing once half way through.
3. ​Prepare your pasta noodles according to package instructions except reduce the cooking time by 2 minutes. When the time is up, reserve 2 cups of the pasta cooking water. Drain the pasta in a colander.
While the pasta drains, place the pot back on the stove over medium heat. Add the oil. When the oil is shimmering, add the garlic and cook it for 30 seconds. Add the water and miso – whisk well until the miso is dissolved.

4. Whisk in the nutritional yeast, rice wine vinegar and black pepper to taste. Add the pasta back to the pot, stirring to coat and bring to a simmer for 1-2 minutes, or until the noodles are al dente. The sauce will look thin at first but it will thicken as the noodles finish cooking.
5. Serve the pasta immediately with roasted cauliflower over the top, and garnish with green onions and chili flakes if desired.
