1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Spray a 13×9″ baking dish with cooking spray. (I used the butter PAM). Add thinly sliced potatoes to a large bowl with water. This will keep the potatoes from browning.
2. To a small sauce pan add milk, garlic cloves, nutmeg and fresh thyme. Bring to a boil then add butter. Stir while the butt melts. Set aside.
3. Arrange half of the potatoes to the prepared baking dish. Season with salt and pepper. Cover with half the shredded white cheddar cheese and half the parmesan cheese. Arrange the remaining potatoes. Season with salt and pepper. Pour the milk mixture of the potatoes, making sure to evenly coat. Finish with remaining white cheddar cheese and parmesan cheese.
4. Bake, uncovered, for 40 minutes or until potatoes are tender the top is slightly browned. Serve!
