1. Cook pasta according to package directions; drain, reserving 1 cup pasta cooking water. Return pasta to pot.
2. Meanwhile, in a large skillet cook asparagus and tomatoes over medium-high, stirring frequently and adding water, 1 to 2 tablespoons at a time, as needed to prevent sticking.
3. In a blender combine the next five ingredients (through garlic). Cover and blend until smooth, adding about ½ cup pasta cooking water to make a smooth sauce. Add sauce and Aleppo pepper to pasta in pot. Toss to combine, adding an additional ¼ to ½ cup pasta cooking water as needed for desired consistency. Season with salt.
4. Spoon pasta into bowls. Top with asparagus mixture and sprinkle with dill and additional Aleppo pepper. Serve with lemon wedges.
