1. In a bowl, melt 2 tbsp. coconut oil and peanut butter, either over double boiler or in the microwave. Add protein powder and stir to combine. Add chocolate chip or chocolate square. Allow this to melt into the chocolate sauce, stirring to incorporate.
2. Drizzle chocolate protein sauce over popcorn, and stir.
3. Place in freezer for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, the chocolate protein coating should have hardened over the popcorn and you can enjoy the popcorn at room temperature. Store leftovers in the fridge.
