1. Heat Â¼ C of water in a pot over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the kale and tomatoes, and continue to cook, stirring until the greens are tender and the liquid is cooked off, about 5 minutes.
2. While the greens are cooking, mash the beans in a bowl and stir in the nutritional yeast, chili powder, and Savory spice blend and hot sauce to taste. Mix well.
3. Drain off any remaining liquid from the greens mixture and then stir into the bean mixture. Taste and adjust the seasonings.
4. Divide the filling among the tortillas, spreading it evenly over the bottom half of each. Fold the top half of the tortilla over the filling, pressing down lightly to hold the halves together. Place two of the quesadillas in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Cook until lightly browned on both sides, turning once, about 3 minutes each side. Serve with salsa.
