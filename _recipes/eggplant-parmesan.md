1. In a large colander, sprinkle the eggplant with salt and set in the sink to drain for 30 minutes.
2. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Place two large baking sheets in the oven to preheat.
3. When the eggplant is ready, place on a paper towel-lined plate or cutting board and press down with additional paper towels to absorb any excess moisture and salt. Remove the baking sheets from the oven and coat with nonstick cooking spray.
4. In a shallow bowl, beat the egg whites and water. Place the bread crumbs on a plate. Dip each eggplant slice into the egg mixture, letting any excess drip off, and coat with the bread crumbs, pressing to adhere. Place the slices in a single layer on the baking sheets and lightly coat them with nonstick cooking spray. Bake 25 to 30 minutes or until golden and tender, flipping the slices after 15 minutes. Remove the baking sheets from the oven and lower the heat to 400 degrees.
5. Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium-high heat, add the oil (if not using ground beef). Saute the garlic for 1 minute. Add the tomatoes, basil, and oregano and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, or until thickened, stirring occasionally.
6. In the bottom of a 9-by-13 inch baking dish, spread Â½ C of the sauce. Arrange half the eggplant slices over the sauce, overlapping them slightly. Spoon half of the remaining sauce over the eggplant and top with half of the mozzarella and half of the Parmesan. Arrange the remaining eggplant slices in another layer. Top with the remaining sauce, mozzarella, and Parmesan. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the cheese melts. Let rest for 5 minutes before serving.
