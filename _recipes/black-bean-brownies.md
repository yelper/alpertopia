1. Set oven to 350F.
2. Pour all of the above ingredients – except for chocolate chips and walnuts – into a blender.  Blend until the batter is smooth. Pour the batter into a large bowl. Add about 75% of the chocolate chunks and 75% of the walnuts, the remaining pieces will be used for the topping. Mix the batter together.
3. Spray a baking dish with nonstick cooking spray and pour in the batter. If desired, or needed because the coating on your baking dish is worn, you can also line the baking dish with parchment paper.
4. Spread out the batter in the baking dish using a spatula, then top with the remaining chocolate chunks and walnuts.
5. Bake in the oven for 25 minutes or until you can pierce the brownies with a toothpick and it comes out clean. Allow the brownies to cool to at least room temperature before initially cutting them. Enjoy!
