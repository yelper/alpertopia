1. Whisk together all ingredients in a medium sauce pan. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer, cover and cook 15 minutes stirring occasionally.
2. As the sauce simmers, feel free to add a few tablespoons of water to thin sauce to desired consistency.
3.  Sauce may be served immediately but if you have some extra time, cover and chill for at least 1 hour for best flavor. Enjoy!
