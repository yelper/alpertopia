1. Take a cup of leftover almond pulp (from making almond milk, or 1 cup pre-soaked, peeled and chopped almonds) and 1 cup soft dates and pulse together in your food processor to break the ingredients apart.
2. Add desiccated coconut, cacao, melted coconut oil, a slice of orange, and a pinch of salt. Blend in food processor until thoroughly combined and you get a sticky blended mixture, that will hold together.
3. Remove the dough from the food processor and add to a bowl. Take a pinch of dough the size of a walnut, press together and then roll into a small ball. Place on a plate and repeat to use up all the mixture.
4. Prepare your decorations on separate plates. Take an energy ball and roll it in either coconut flour, cacao powder or cinnamon until thoroughly coated and set back on plate or in a container.
5. Store in fridge in an airtight container for up to a week.
