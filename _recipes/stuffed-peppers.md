1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

2. Cut off the tops of the peppers and carefully remove the seeds and large membranes. Slive a thin strip off the bottom of each bell pepper so it can stand upright. Place the peppers in a steamer rack over boiling water. Cover and cook for 5 minutes. Transfer the peppers to a baking pan.

3. Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium-high heat, add the oil. Saute the turkey and scallions for 5 to 8 minutes, or until the turkey is cooked through. Add the garlic, cinnamon, cloves and red pepper flakes and saute for 1 minute. Add the tomato sauce, reduce the heat and simmer, stirring to combine. Add the rice, currants, olives, and almonds and stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper.

4. Spoon the turkey mixture into the peppers. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until heated through.
