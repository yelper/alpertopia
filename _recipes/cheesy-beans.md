1. Mince the garlic and finely dice the jalapeño (remove the stem and seeds). Add the garlic, jalapeño, and cooking oil to a pot. Sauté the garlic and jalapeño over medium heat for about one minute, or just until the garlic is very fragrant.
2. Add one can of pinto beans to a blender, with the liquid in the can, and purée until smooth. Add the puréed beans and the second can of beans (drained) to the saucepot with the garlic and jalapeño. Stir to combine. Season the beans with the smoked paprika, cumin, pepper, and hot sauce. Stir to combine, then heat through over medium, stirring occasionally.
3. Finally, add the shredded cheddar and stir until it has melted smoothly into the beans. Taste the beans and adjust the seasoning to your liking. Serve over rice or with your favorite meal.
