1. Wash the chili peppers and remove the stems, then give them a rough chop (if they are large or your blender is not powerful)  to help your blender or food processor make this easy work IMPORTANT!  Be sure to wear gloves and wash your hands immediately  after with soap and water. I used the seeds of the pepper, but if you’d like to tame the heat down a bit you can remove and discard them.

2. Half the passion fruit and put pulp in blender. Shell the garlic into blender. Roughly chop up the onion. Remove the stems from the hot chilli peppers and add to blender.

3. Add all of the remaining ingredients to the blender and blend for 1 minute.

4. Strain mixture into pot. Cook all the ingredients,  in a saucepan until it is bubbling away.

5. Strain seed particles out of the mixture again because they expand. The habanero and birds eye chilli seeds and passionfruit seeds will expand slightly with the heat and are easier to get out now.

6. Mix xanthin gum with olive oil and then put this into the blender and blend again until happy with consistency.

7. You can always tailor this pepper sauce to your own liking, by leaving it chunky or by adding other fruits you like (mango, berries etc) and if you need, you can also add a bit more vinegar should you need it (if it’s too thick).
