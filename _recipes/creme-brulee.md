1. Gather all ingredients, and preheat the oven to 300° F. Bring a large pot of water to a boil for a water bath to cook the custards. Egg yolks, sugar and chocolate on marble table.
2. In a double boiler over low heat, melt the chocolate. Or, melt in 20 second pulses in the microwave on low, stirring frequently. Set aside to cool slightly. Melted chocolate in small white bowl.
3. In a medium bowl, whisk together by hand the egg yolks and sugar. Egg yolks and sugar in shallow bowl.
4. Once well incorporated, add the room temperature heavy cream. Melted chocolate poured into custard mixture.
5. Pour in the melted chocolate mixture. Divide the mixture between two 6-ounce ramekins. Place the ramekins in a small baking dish and add the hot water until it comes up ½ way on the sides of ramekins. Move the baking dish carefully to the oven and bake about 40-44 minutes, until the custard is set. The middle will slightly jiggle, but the sides will be set. Let the custards cool in the water bath completely before removing them. Chocolate creme brulee in ramekins in a baking dish with water.
