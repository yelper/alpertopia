1. Preheat oven to 350ºF. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.
2. In the bowl of an electric mixer, on medium speed, beat together the sugar, oil, eggs, banana, vanilla, baking powder, and salt until smooth and creamy.
3. Turn the mixer to low. Add cocoa powder, all-purpose flour, and whole wheat flour. Beat until a smooth and slightly sticky dough forms. If using, stir in the chocolate chips.
4. Form two logs along the length of the prepared baking sheet. The dough will be slightly sticky, so I found it easiest to form the logs with slightly moistened hands.
5. Bake for 30 minutes, then remove from oven and set aside to cool for a few minutes, until cool enough to slice.
6. Slice each log on the diagonal into biscotti about ¾-inch. Bake for 10 minutes, flip each cookie over, then bake for an additional 10 minutes.

Plan Ahead:
These cookies freeze well in an airtight container or bag.
