1. Start by slicing the meat against the grain in thin slices. Dice the onion and cut the fresh broccoli. You want all of these things done before you get started. In a medium bowl, combine the soy sauce, brown sugar, beef broth, garlic and ginger. I hardly ever use ginger so I used the powdered ginger spice instead of the fresh. Don't add the starch until the very end. (I accidentally added the starch before and my pressure cooker never came to pressure because there was not enough liquid to make it work. It's okay, I'm happy to share my failures with you so that you don't make the same mistakes I do)
2. Add this liquid mixture to the meat strips. Add about 3 tablespoons of olive oil or peanut oil to your pressure cooker and saute the onions until they are translucent in color. Add the meat combined with the liquid marinade to the pressure cooker and set it on manual high pressure for 10 minutes. The quick release the pressure value.
3. Carefully remove about a 1/3 cup of the hot juices and add 2 tablespoons of cornstarch. Use a fork or a whisk to make sure the cornstarch is well combined. I find it easier to combine cornstarch in hot liquid. If you prefer, you can use warm water also. I've done it both ways and it hardly makes a difference. Add the mixture back into the pressure cooker and stir. You will notice the liquid begin to thicken as it sits.
4. Place the pound of broccoli in the microwave on high for about 5 minutes with 1 cup of water. This will steam it to the perfect consistency. Works for both frozen and fresh broccoli.
5. Drain the water from the broccoli and mix it in to the beef mixture in your pressure cooker. The beef and broccoli is done and ready to serve over rice!
