1. Either refrigerate the coconut milk can overnight, or open and freeze about 10 minutes. (I store a can in the fridge so thereâ€™s always one ready to go. Be sure to use full-fat canned coconut milk for this recipe. Try not to shake the can, because you want the cream separate from the water underneath.)
2. Once cold, open the can and transfer only the thick part to a bowl. Discard the watery part, or save for another recipe. Using either a stand mixer or hand beaters (or a fork and a ton of strength and patience), whip the cream until smooth. Add remaining ingredients and whip until it forms a mousse-like texture.
