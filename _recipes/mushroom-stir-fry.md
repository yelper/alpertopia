1. Wrap the tofu in a dish towel, let sit for 10-15 minutes. Remove the plate, unwrap the tofu, and cut into Â½ inch cubes.
2. In a large work, heat the avocado oil and 1 T of the soy sauce over medium-high heat. Add the tofu and fry, stirring occasionally, until all sides are lightly brown, 5-7 minutes. Transfer the tofu to a plate.
3. Reduce the heat to medium, then add the mushrooms and saute for about 5 minutes, until tender. Add the remaining 1 T of soy sauce, bok choy, scallions, and garlic. Cook 1-2 minutes more. Reduce the heat to low and add the broth and ginger. Stir to combine and simmer until heated through and fragrant, another 2-3 minutes.
4. Return tofu to the plan, stir in sesame oil and sesame seeds, and toss together.
5. Serve the stir fry over rice and add sriracha.
