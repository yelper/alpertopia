1. In a food processor, combine the frozen bananas with the cocoa powder, ground chia, and vanilla. Process until fairly smooth. 

2. Add the pitted cherries and pulse into the mixture. Process until reaches desired texture. Enjoy as is, or freeze for 4-5 hours and then serve. If freezing longer, allow the nice cream to thaw just slightly to scoop it out easier.
