1. Pour beef broth in a small bowl.  Add salt, pepper, cumin, chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, oregano and crushed red pepper flakes.  Whisk to combine and set aside.
2. Pour oil into your Instant Pot and set to saute.  When oil is heated, sear roast on all sides until browned.  Turn off Instant Pot.
3. Pour beef broth mixture and salsa over roast.
4. Place the lid on pressure cooker and lock.  Steam release knob should be set on “sealing”.  Cook on manual setting (high pressure) for 70 minutes.  Allow pressure to release naturally.
5. Remove beef from pressure cooker and shred with 2 forks, discarding any fat.  Allow fat to rise in liquid and skim off fat.  Return beef to liquid mixture.
