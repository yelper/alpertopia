1. Cut the sausages at an angle into 1-inch pieces. Preheat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once the skillet is hot, add oil and swirl to coat the bottom.
2. Add the sausage to the skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, until they are browned on all sides and almost cooked through, 10-12 minutes.
3. Meanwhile, wash and snap or cut off the woody ends of the asparagus; then cut into 2-inch pieces. Peel and mince garlic. Roughly chop walnuts.
4. When the sausage is almost cooked through, add asparagus and garlic; continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until asparagus is crisp-tender, about 4 minutes.
5. Add vinegar, oil, Dijon, walnuts, salt, and pepper to the skillet; toss to combine and continue to cook until heated through, about 2 minutes. To serve, divide the sausage and asparagus between plates and enjoy!
