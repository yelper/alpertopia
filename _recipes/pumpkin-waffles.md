1. In a large bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients: flour, cornstarch, pumpkin pie spice, salt, baking powder, baking soda and salt.
2. In a large measuring cup, measure out the buttermilk. Whisk in the pumpkin puree, oil, melted butter and vanilla. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix until barely combined. Set aside.
3. In another bowl, using a hand-mixer, beat the egg whites until foamy. Add the sugar and continue beating until stiff, glossy peaks form. Fold the egg whites into the batter until just combined.
4. Cook the batter according to your waffle iron’s instructions. I cooked mine for about 3 minutes. Repeat until you’ve worked your way through the batter. Serve with maple syrup and butter.
