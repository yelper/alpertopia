1. Finely slice the Chinese cabbage and place in abowl. Add salt and mix together. Leave this to sit for 5 minutes. The salt willdraw out the moisture from the cabbage. After 5 minutes has passed, using yourhands, squeeze out any remaining water from the cabbage. Prepare the other ingredients in separate bowls for easy management.
2. Mix the ground chicken, Chinese cabbage, scallions, soy sauce, sake, mirin, and grated garlic in a bowl.
3. Place a gyoza wrapper in your weaker hand. With one finger, add a little water to the edge of one side of the gyoza. This willhelp with binding it together. Place 1 tbsp of filling in the center. Do not put too much as it will be hard to wrap the gyoza!
4. Fold the gyoza in half. Then with your strongerhand, use your thumb and index finger to make small pleats along the edge ofone side of the gyoza. Aim for around 4 to 5 for one gyoza. Push the two sidesof the gyoza together as you make each pleat to help seal it tightly. Shape thegyoza so they are slightly curved.
5. Heat your pan to a medium heat. Add a neutral oil and then add your gyoza with the flat side down. Fry until light brown on the bottom. Add 50ml water (about 1/4 cup) in thepan and cover with a lid. Wait till the water has mostly evaporated. This may take around 3 minutes.
6. Take off the lid if there is any remaining water, keep cooking until it is 100% evaporated. Serve and enjoy!
