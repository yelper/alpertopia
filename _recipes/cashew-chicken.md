1. Lightly toast the nuts in a dry skillet over medium heat 1 minute, stirring, then set aside. Put the egg into a large bowl, add the cornstarch and a pinch of salt and whisk to combine. Add the chicken and coat with the egg mixture.

2. Heat a skillet or wok with olive oil over medium heat. Stir-fry the chicken 4-5 minutes until lightly colored, then remove with a slotted spoon.

3. Add the green onions and stir-fry for a few seconds. Add the snow peas, bok choy, and peppers and stir fry for 1 minute longer, or until just soft. Add the chicken, mushrooms, stock, lime juice and soy sauce to taste. Simmer 1 minute longer, or until the mushrooms are soft. Stir in the nuts and cilantro, then season with salt and pepper and sriracha. Serve.
