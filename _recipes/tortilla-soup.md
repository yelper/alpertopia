1. In a large heavy bottomed pot or dutch oven, heat 2 tbsp of olive oil over medium heat. Add the shallots, sweet potatoes, corn, and jalapeno and Â½ teaspoon of kosher salt. Stir until the shallots and potatoes become softened, about 10 minutes.
2. Add the garlic, chili powder, and cumin and stir till fragrant. Then add your beans and tomatoes and stir to combine. Finally add your broth. Turn the heat up to medium high and allow it to come to a low simmer. Continue to simmer (not boil) for about 30 minutes.
3. Once the soup is ready, stir in any additional salt, 2 tablespoon of vinegar, and fresh cilantro. Top with tortilla chips when ready to serve.
4. If you'd like to make your own tortilla chips like I did, preheat your oven to 400 degrees, brush your tortilla with olive oil on both sides, and bake for about 7-9 minutes until lightly browned.
