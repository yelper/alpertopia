1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.
2. Spread the tomatoes out on a sheet pan and nestle in the onions and garlic cloves. Drizzle on the olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Roast for 15 minutes, and remove from the oven. Flip the tomatoes and roast for another 15 minutes or until browned and caramelized.
4. Meanwhile, simmer the broth and greens over low heat simmer and covered with a lid for 10 minutes. When the tomatoes are done roasting combine them in a blender with the broth and greens. Process until smooth. Taste and season with more salt and pepper if desired and set aside.
6. Serve the soup hot and with a generous drizzle of more olive oil and cracked pepper.
