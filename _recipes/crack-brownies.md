1. Position an oven rack in the middle of the oven and heat to 325 degrees F. Line the bottom and sides of an 9X13 baking pan with parchment paper or aluminum foil, leaving an overhang on opposite sides to help remove the baked brownies from the pan.

2. Prepare a double-boiler by filling a medium saucepan with water about 2 inches deep. Heat the water until barely simmering. See the notes section below for tips on making these without a double-boiler and instead using a microwave or making them directly in a saucepan. Combine the butter, sugar, cocoa powder, and salt in a medium heat-safe bowl. Rest the bowl over the simmering water. If the bottom of the bowl touches the water, remove a little water from the saucepan.Stir the mixture occasionally until the butter has melted and the mixture is quite warm. Don’t worry if it looks gritty; it will become smooth once you add the eggs and flour. Remove the bowl from the saucepan, and set aside for 5 minutes or until it is only warm, not hot. 
3. Stir in the vanilla. Add the eggs, one at a time, stirring vigorously after each one. When the batter looks thick and well blended, add the flour. Use a spoon to beat the flour into the batter until it is very thick and pulls away from the sides of the bowl. We use a wooden spoon or spatula and beat for 40 to 50 strokes (see video for reference).

4. Spread the batter evenly in the prepared pan. Bake the brownies until the edges look dry and the middle looks slightly underbaked; 20 to 30 minutes. You can test doneness by inserting a toothpick into the center. The brownies are finished baking if it comes out with a few moist crumbs attached. Cool completely before removing from the pan — this step is essential and helps the brownies set. 
5. Add the “slightly softened” Butter (somewhere in between straight out of the refrigerator and room temperature) to the mixing bowl along with the Vanilla Extract. Mix the Butter and Vanilla together until they are fully combined (about 2 minutes on medium speed.) You want the Vanilla to fully meld with the Butter to get the best-flavored frosting possible.

6. Scrape the sides of the bowl down before moving on to the next step of the recipe. Measure 1 pound of Powdered Sugar.  If you don’t have a food scale, the equivalent is 4 cups. Add the Powdered Sugar to the mixing bowl. Start your mixer (or electric beater) on the lowest setting. Keep on low until the butter and sugar are incorporated (about 30 seconds). Stop the mixer and scrape down the sides of the bowl. Increase the mixer speed to medium-high and mix for 30-45 more seconds until the frosting starts to be light and fluffy. If the frosting is still dry or crumbly, add 1 teaspoon of Milk and mix again.

7. Taste your frosting! You are trying to determine if the consistency is correct or if it needs a tiny bit more Vanilla Extract. Depending on how it tastes, you will take the next step.  If the frosting has the right taste but is too thick, add some Milk and mix again to check to see if it is now the right consistency.  How much milk? That depends on the state of your frosting. A good rule of thumb is to add the milk a teaspoon at a time.

8. Frost brownies with frosting. Sprinkle with peanuts; refrigerate while making cereal mixture.
9. Measure cereal into large bowl; set aside. In 1-quart saucepan, melt peanut butter and chocolate chips over low heat, stirring constantly. Pour over cereal in bowl, stirring until evenly coated. Spread over frosted brownies. Refrigerate about 1 hour or until set before cutting. Cut into 4 rows by 4 rows. Store tightly covered in refrigerator.
