1. In a small bowl, whisk together the peanut butter, warm water, tamari, maple syrup, lime zest and juice, garlic, ginger, and pepper sauce until smooth. The sauce can also be pureed in a blender for even easier preparation. Set aside.
2. In a large bowl, toss together the edamame, carrot, shallot, bell pepper, red cabbage, three-quarters of the spring onions, and peanuts.
3. Cook the soba noodles according to the package directions. Drain and rinse noodles. Add the noodles to the mixed vegetables and pour on three-quarters of the peanut sauce. Using tongs mix to combine. Serve with a drizzle of the remaining sauce on top, a sprinkle of toasted sesame seeds, a pinch of cilantro, and the remaining spring onions.
