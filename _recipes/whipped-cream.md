1. Place the can of coconut cream into the coldest part of your refrigerator and leave it there overnight.
2. The next day, take it out and carefully open it (don’t shake it around!). You’ll see that the cream part has separated from the water and risen to the top. Scoop that out into the bowl of an electric mixer, leaving the water behind. You can use the water in a smoothie or throw it out.
3. Starting at slow speed gradually increase speed until you achieve a whipped cream consistency. The harder the consistency of the cream when you scoop it out, the quicker this will be. Once you have whipped cream consistency, you can stop right there. You're done! OR: Add some powdered sugar and vanilla for a sweetened cream. Whisk again until mixed in.
