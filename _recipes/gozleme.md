1. Saute the onion with olive oil until it is softened, add garlic. When the smells come out turn the heat off. Add the red pepper paste, spinach and feta cheese, toss. Put it a side.
2. Dough Preparation: In a small bowl, mix the yeast, sugar and 1/4 cup warm water. Stir well so the yeast dissolves. Let it rest for 15 minutes. In a large bowl, sift the flour and salt. Add in the bubbly yeast mixture and 3/4 cup warm water and olive oil. Mix and place the dough on the lightly floured counter. Knead well for about 10 minutes until it becomes smooth (no more crumbles). Then spread 1 tsp of olive oil inside a clean bowl. Place the dough in it and turn it upside down to spread olive oil all the surface. Then cover it with a clean, damp towel. Put aside for about an hour at room temperature until the dough rises to double its size.

3. Place the dough on the lightly floured counter. Press all over with your hands to get rid of any air bubbles. Cut the dough in 4 pieces with a knife. Knead and give a ball shape to each, cover with a damp towel, and put aside for about 15 minutes. With your hands to flatten and then use a roller give a long oval shape each one. Dived the filling in two, spread on the each dough. Fold the long sides towards the inside, then twist the ends to give a boat shape.

4. Place parchment paper on an oven tray, then arrange the dough on it. Brush some yogurt mixture along the edges. Preheat the oven to 500 F (250 C). Place the tray on the middle rack and bake for about 15 minutes. Immediately brush butter or olive oil on the edges.

5. Meanwhile poached one egg for each pide. Boil 3 cups water with 1 tbsp salt and 1 tbsp vinegar in a large pot. After bubbling, turn down the heat to medium-low. Crack the eggs into the water side by side. Cover and let the eggs cook for 3 minutes. Take the eggs out with a perforated spoon. Place the eggs over the top of the each Spinach Pide. Serve with lemon wedges.
