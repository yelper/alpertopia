1. This doesn't all fit in the mixer, so do half at a time.
2. Preheat oven to 375Â° and line an 8"-x-4" loaf pan with parchment paper. Separate egg whites and egg yolks. Can cook in toaster oven.
3. In a large bowl, combine egg whites and cream of tartar. Using a hand mixer, whip until stiff peaks form.
4. In a separate large bowl using a hand mixer, beat yolks with melted butter, almond flour, baking powder, and salt. Fold in 1/3 of the whipped egg whites until fully incorporated, then fold in the rest.
5. Pour batter into loaf pan and smooth top. Bake for 30 minutes, or until top is slightly golden and toothpick inserted comes out clean. Let cool 30 minutes before slicing.
