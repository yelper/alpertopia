1. Spray the air fryer basket with oil. In a small bowl, mix the spices, salt and pepper well to combine.
2. Pat fish dry and then lay it in the air fryer basket. Brush with olive oil. Generously cover the fish with the spice rub and gently press it into the fish. Spritz over top of the fish with oil to help it all hold to the fish and stay moist.
3. Preheat air fryer to 400°F. Heat the fish for about 8-10 minutes or until opaque and easily flakes. Internal temperature should reach 145°F.
4. While the fish cooks, toss together the ingredients for the cilantro lime slaw. Adjust the salt to taste or add more lime juice as desired.
5. When fish is cooked, remove from the air fryer basket. Cut into small pieces and add to tortillas and top with slaw. Add an extra squeeze of lime. Store in an air tight container in the refrigerator for 2-3 days.
6. To reheat, air fry the fish for about 2-4 minutes until hot.
