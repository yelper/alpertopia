1. Set oven to broil.
2. Add zucchini and squash to a baking tray lined with parchment paper.  Lightly spray with oil then sprinkle on the oregano.  Add the zucchini to the broiler and cook for 3 – 4 minutes MAX.
3. Set a nonstick skillet on high heat, spray with oil, then add the sausage.  Sear and cook the sausage for 3 – 5 minutes, or until sear marks appear along the edges.
4. Reduce the heat to low and remove the skillet to cool down some.  Add the roasted veggies to the pan, along with freshly chopped sage and the butter.  Toss everything together in the skillet.  Season to taste with sea salt & pepper.
