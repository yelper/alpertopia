1. In a large pot combine mushrooms, onion, garlic, and ginger. Cook over medium 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. (The mushrooms should release enough liquid to prevent vegetables from sticking to pan.)
2. Add broth, sweet potato, and carrots. Bring to boiling; reduce heat. Simmer, uncovered, 10 minutes. Add noodles and 2 cups water. Cook over medium 10 minutes more or until noodles are tender.
3. In a small bowl whisk together milk and miso. Stir into soup. Add tofu, peas, and vinegar. Taste and adjust seasoning.
4. Use a pasta fork or tongs to scoop noodles and vegetables into bowls. Ladle broth over top. Garnish with scallions and, if desired, nori and/or togarashi.
