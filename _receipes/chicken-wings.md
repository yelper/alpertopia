1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees.
2. Make the rub for the chicken by combining garlic powder, paprika, salt, pepper, and baking powder. Coat wings evenly with rub and place on a foil-lined pan. As pictured above, I recommend using a cooling rack on top of a baking sheet for extra crispiness.
3. Bake for 20 minutes and turn wings. Bake for another 20-30 minutes until desired crispiness.
4. Combine ingredients for sauce and coat wings evenly. Serve wings as is or place wings back in oven so for an extra 10 minutes to allow sauce to caramelize.
5. Top with sesame seeds if desired.
