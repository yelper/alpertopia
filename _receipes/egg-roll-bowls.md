1. Make sure your egg roll wrappers are defrosted before you begin this recipe. I forgot and ending up pulling them apart in pieces...but it was still good! Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Cut your wrappers or tortillas into roughly Â½" x 3" pieces, place them on a baking sheet, and brush them with a little olive oil. I used about 3 wrappers total, but you can make more or less as you'd like. You can also cook them full size as wonton "chips". Bake them in the oven for about 5 minutes until golden brown, but watch carefully.

2. In a large pan, heat 1 tablespoon of oil over medium-high heat. Add raw meat and cook for about 4-5 minutes until no pink remains, breaking up with a wooden spoon. If there's any excess juice in the pan, drain or pat with a paper towel.

3. Turn heat to medium and add garlic and ginger, cooking for about a minute, stirring often. Add cabbage slaw mix and most of the green onions (save a bit for garnigh) and cook for around 3 minutes until softened. Then add broth, coconut aminos (or soy substitute), and sesame oil, stirring to combine everything.

4. Place all the ingredients in a bowl and top with toasted egg roll wrappers, sriracha and green onions. Eat immediately
