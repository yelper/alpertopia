1. Preheat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once the skillet is hot, add 2 tsp oil and swirl to coat the bottom. Add the ground turkey to the skillet; cook, breaking apart with a spoon until nearly cooked through, 3-4 minutes.

4. Peel and mince garlic. Peel and small dice onion. Add both to the skillet. Peel and mince or grate the ginger. Add to the skillet with the turkey and sauté for 30 seconds. Peel the carrots and trim off the ends, then julienne or coarsely grate. Add to the skillet.

5. Trim off and discard the root end of the cabbage; halve the cabbage lengthwise, then thinly slice crosswise into shreds and add to the skillet. Season veggies and turkey with soy sauce and crushed red pepper; stir to combine. Cook, stirring occasionally, until cabbage and carrots have softened, 4-5 minutes.

6. Meanwhile, trim off and discard the ends of the green onions; cut the onions crosswise into ¼-inch pieces at an angle, set aside. When cabbage is cooked, drain off excess liquid, and turn the heat down to low. Make a well in the center of the skillet and crack the eggs into it. Scramble until no longer runny, 1-2 minutes, then stir to combine.


7. In a small bowl mix together chili-garlic sauce, salt, and mayo. To serve divide egg roll mixture between bowls, top with green onions, sesame seeds, and spicy mayo. Enjoy!
