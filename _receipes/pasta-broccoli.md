1. Prepare the pasta to package directions for al dente. About 2 minutes before pasta is ready, add the broccoli. Reserve Â¼ C of the pasta water before draining.
2. Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium heat, add the olive oil. Saute the garlic for 1 minute. Add the broth and bring to a boil for 3 to 5 minutes or until reduced by half, stirring frequently. Reduce the heat, add the pasta and broccoli, and stir until coated with sauce. Add the basil and parsley and stir to combine. Transfer to a bowl and drizzle with olive oil (if too dry, add a tablespoon or so of reserved cooking liquid). Top with cheese and pine nuts. Season with salt and pepper.
