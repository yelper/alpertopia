1. In a pan over medium low heat, cook the coconut until it is browned and toasted, about 10 minutes. Stir regularly to prevent burning. Let cool, about 10 minutes.
2. In a large bowl sift together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Stir in the mini chocolate chips and the toasted coconut.
3. In a different bowl, whisk together the egg, milk, and melted butter.
4. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and pour in the milk mixture.
5. Use a whisk to mix together all the ingredients. be careful not to overwork the mixture or the pancakes will be tough.
6. Preheat a griddle or pan over medium-low heat until hot. Lightly brush it with some oil or melted butter. Use a ⅓ cup measuring cup to pour out a pancake. Cook for 2 minutes or until bubbles begin to pop, the pancake starts to hold shape. The pancakes should be lightly brown on the bottom.
7. Flip the pancake and cook for another 3 minutes, or until the batter is cooked throughout. Transfer to a plate, oil the griddle or pan again, and repeat as needed.
8. Combine the heavy whipping cream, sugar, and pure vanilla extract into a bowl. Use a whisk or an electric mixer with the whisk attachment to whip the cream. You want it to reach “stiff peaks” (when the whipped cream stands up on its own after the whisk is removed). Top the pancakes with maple syrup and a healthy dollop of whipped cream.  Serve.
