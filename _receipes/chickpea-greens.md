1. If without cooked quinoa, add one part uncooked quinoa to two parts boiling salted water in a saucepan. Bring to boil, cover, reduce heat to low for 10-15 minutes, until the quinoa grains have opened up and the liquid has evaporated. Leave to cool.
2. Set a nonstick skillet on medium heat. Once hot, add oil and garlic. Flavor the oil for about 1-2 minutes, then increase the heat to medium-high.
3. Add the chickpeas. While they sear in the skillet, add the smoked paprika. Shake the skillet to coat the chickpeas, then add lemon and a pinch of sea salt & pepper. The chickpeas are finished when they have a light sear on the outside.
4. Remove the chickpeas and keep the skillet on the heat. Spray with olive oil then toss the shredded kale. Quickly stir so it doesnâ€™t burn, then pour in the water to create steam and continue stirring.
5. Once the kale has turned vibrant green, about 2 minutes, remove the kale from the skillet and season to taste with a pinch of sea salt & pepper.
6. Add everything to a bowl, including the cooked quinoa and fold together. Serve into your containers alongside a slice of lemon and your favorite low-calorie Italian dressing on the side (keep this separate until ready to eat). Enjoy!
