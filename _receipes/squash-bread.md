1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit. Grease or line two loaf pans; set aside.
2. Place the melted butter, sugar, lemon juice and zest, almond flavor and vanilla extract in a large mixing bowl. Cream together until fluffy and light in color, about 1 to 2 minutes.
3. Add the eggs one at a time, allowing each egg to fully incorporate into the mixture before adding another.
4. Evenly sprinkle the salt, baking soda, and baking powder over the top of the mixture. Mix well.
5. Working in batches, add the flour a Â½ cup at a time; mix in entirely between additions. Fold in the squash and poppy seeds. Divide the batter between the prepared loaf pans. Bake for 1 hour, until a toothpick inserted into the middle of the loaf comes out clean.
