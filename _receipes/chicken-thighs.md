1. Preheat your oven to 400 degrees F. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with high-heat-resistant parchment paper.
2. Arrange the chicken thighs in a single layer in the prepared pan. It's best if they do not touch each other. Flatten them and gently stretch the skin so that it covers the meat completely.
3. Sprinkle the chicken pieces with the seasonings. Bake them until the skin is browned and crispy and an instant-read thermometer not touching the bones reads 165 degrees F, about 45 minutes.
4. Transfer the thighs to a serving plate. Loosely cover them with foil and allow them to rest for 5 minutes before serving.
