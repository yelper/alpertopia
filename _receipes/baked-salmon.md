1. Preheat oven to 400.
2. In a 9x13 baking dish, toss the potatoes with 1 T of olive oil, ½ t of herbes de Provence, ¼ t of salt, and ⅛ t of pepper. Cover the dish with aluminum foil and roast until the potatoes start to soften, about 30 minutes.
3. Add the asparagus to the pan, toss the vegetables to coat with the oil and bake, uncovered until the potatoes start to brown and the asparagus softens, about 15 minutes.
4. Add the tomatoes and onion to the pan and nestle the salmon in the vegetables. Sprinkle with the remaining 2 T of oil, remaining ½ t of herbes de Provence, remaining ¼ t of salt, remaining ⅛ t of pepper and the vinegar. Return to the oven to bake for 10 minutes, or until the salmon is just cooked through and starting to flake, and with a little translucency still in the thickest part.
5. Sprinkle the basil leaves over the top and serve.
