1. In a medium skillet over medium heat, melt butter. Slowly add pan drippings and broth, whisking until smooth. Bring to a boil, then add Worcestershire and garlic powder and season with salt and pepper. Reduce heat and let simmer 10 minutes. 

2. Add xanthan gum and whisk to combine. Let simmer another 5 to 10 minutes until starting to thicken. Gravy will thicken more as it cools.  

3. If gravy is too thick, thin with more broth as necessary. Serve warm.
