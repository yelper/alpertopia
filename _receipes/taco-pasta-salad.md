1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees(F).
Make the vinaigrette. In a medium sized mixing bowl, whisk together all the vinaigrette ingredients. Set aside.
2. Now, make the tofu. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, olive oil, lime juice and zest, garlic, chili powder, oregano, cumin and salt.
3. Crumble your pressed block of tofu into small crumbles, then add them to the bowl.
4. Toss the tofu and make sure the sauce is evenly soaked into the tofu crumbles.
5. Spread the tofu out in a single layer on a large sheet pan that is lined with parchment paper or a silicone mat.
6. Bake for 15 minutes, toss and then bake another 8-10 minutes or until the tofu crumbles are firm and brown.
7. Once the tofu is done, let that cool for about 15 minutes.
8. When the pasta and tofu have cooled to room temperature, combine everything.
9. Pour the vinaigrette over the pasta and toss to coat, then add the tofu crumbles, onion and cilantro.  Toss to combine.
10. Taste and adjust seasonings. Chill and serve cold. You can serve warm too, chilled is just my preference.
