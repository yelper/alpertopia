1. In a food processor, combine  1 cup of the chickpeas with the curry powder, lemon, sugar, miso, cayenne and Savory Spice Blend to taste with 3 T of water. Process until smooth. Add the remaining Â½ C of chickpeas and the celery, carrots, cashews, raisins, apple and scallion and pulse just to combine and break up the chickpeas a bit. Taste and adjust the seasonings if needed.
2. To assembly, divide the chickpea mixture evenly onto the tortillas and top each with the lettuce. Tightly roll up each of the tortillas to make a wrap.
