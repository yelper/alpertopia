Accessibility has been the top of mind of several of us on [the Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/what-is-power-bi/) team.  We reached a strong milestone last year in [achieving full keyboard interactivity within all elements of the report canvas](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/desktop-accessibility-keyboard-shortcuts), allowing full functionality for keyboard users and enabling new workflows combining keyboard and mouse interactions.

Our accessibility efforts are guided by online/software accessibility standards (e.g, [WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/)) as well as government regulations (e.g., [US Section 508](https://www.epa.gov/accessibility/what-section-508) and [EN 301 549](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EN_301_549)).  These standards address how screen readers read out content and layout, as well as prescribing how users should be able to interact with elements using just a keyboard.  However, there is very meager discussion on what constitutes good practice for making a particular visualizationâ€”or more appropriately, a page, report, or dashboard full of visualizationsâ€”accessible.

This blog post tries to work toward a "good" standard for accessible reports using visualization.  Note that I am not a lawyer nor speaking on behalf of private conversations happening at my employer. ðŸ™ƒ

Let's start by talking about the functionality to ensure content are accessible, specifically these  visualization-dominant reports.  In my mind, there are two primary functions to consider when designing accessibility in a visually-focused: keyboard interactivity and screen readers.  Starting from the basics:

* **Keyboard navigation** â€” Enables limited-dexterity users to navigate between interactive elements in two-dimensional space and take action (e.g., change pages, cross-highlight a particular data point).
* **Screen readers** â€” Enables limited-vision users to navigate and consume content via a text-to-speech interface.  Generally has an additive mode named _scan mode_, which changes the keyboard navigation mode to instead get overview of narrative structure such as headings and reading content instead of typical _navigation mode_ (finding and understanding available controls and interactions).

The bar for accountability to make an accessible report is high.  There's a lot of consideration here that goes beyond making sure the right HTML tags, ARIA attributes and role, and interactive elements are being used and labeled correctly.  I won't go too much into depth into the full considerations here when designing an generalized, accessible visual interface, but here's a list of resources that I felt were helpful in my own learning journey:

* []() â€” Understanding the difference between scan mode and nav mode for screen readers
* []() â€” ARIA spec; what roles do and what attributes are required when tagging interactive elements
* []() â€” Considerations for focus traps, "natural" keyboard interaction and hinting

## What are the accessibility issues with reports/dashboards?

Based on my (relatively short!) experience with accessibility concerns in a software product, I've come to some high-level terms of how to manage concerns that come in.  These issues are frequently raised by "trusted testers" who are trained to follow government and organizational regulations.  For software sold to the US government, for example, these trusted testers' processes are governed by [the Department of Homeland Security to follow Section 508](https://section508coordinators.github.io/ICTTestingBaseline/)[^1].  The key thing here is that issues that come in are not necessarily end-users grappling with accessibility issues in the product but instead issues raised by these testers, so they're all pretty low-level issues that don't concern high-level workflow or understandability issues.  In my experience, these low-level accessibility issues come in one of the following flavors:

* **Overview** â€” It isn't clear how the page is laid out or how a user should interact with the page (should I use scan mode to find headings, switch between landmarks, or just tab to find interactive elements?);
* **Navigation** â€” It isn't clear to a user how to navigate or interact with a particular element, what elements can be controlled, or how the page is laid out; and
* **Labeling** â€” It isn't clear to a user what a control does, what a graph is communicating, or there is not sufficient color contrast between foreground and background (whether the OS's high-contrast mode or other accessibility support is/isn't on).

Tackling these issues as they come in feels like a never-ending game a whack-a-mole.  It's especially disheartening as a developer as it's difficult to make a decision at such a low-level; does this or that decision to label this chart piece make sense in the large scheme of things?  Making these spot fixes do not necessarily fix high-level organization or flow issues.

When it comes to making accessible visualizations and visualization-based reports, what's our high-level navigation goal?  Let's make sure that we support all users to be able to understand what's going on in the visualization and are able to interact with all of its controls.

### The ideal construction

In my opinion, **a visualization-based report should be navigable and allow the user to quickly understand the purpose and data characteristics communicated by the report.**  This means that a good standard to strive for is to use already-existing accessibility standards to:

1. create a navigation hierarchy (titles, textareas, visualizations),
2. label visualizations with the data characteristics they communicate, and
3. maintain a hierarchy of controllable interactivity within each visualization (pan/zoom, data point selection, etc.).

Report authors or those who create visualizations for business use generally do not fill in accessibility-specific information such as alt-text unless required to by their jobs.  This is quite unfortunate, as many business-specific applications depend on authors to fill in alt-text to describe complex diagrams or photos.

With the advent of natural language systems and the widespread use of visualization specifications, one could imagine _automatically generating alt-text_, which would greatly reduce friction in authoring accessible and self-describing reports.  This would not just help those users that have vision deficiencies, but also helps to describe visualizations for those users that have limited experience reading and comprehending visualizations (also known as "visualization fluency").  To me, this is the most exciting part of thinking about visualization accessibility critically: it can help all users realize the communicative power of informative data visualization.

## An example!

Let's work through [an example that my PM lead tweeted out recently](https://twitter.com/Will_MI77/status/1339350924049829889) ([direct link to report](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNmYwNzE5ZjMtNDNkMS00N2ZkLTkxNzMtMjYzODdhMDI4MmVjIiwidCI6ImFmZGIzOGQ2LTI0MTgtNDQyYS1hMDI1LWYwODY3MWYzMDRjYiIsImMiOjZ9&pageName=ReportSection5a881db4fd529e567fac)).

![Example report: textbox, two slicers, two summary bar charts, and a line chart broken up into 4-by-5 small multiples]({{ assetdir }}example_report.png){:class="img-fluid"}

There's a couple things at play here in this report.  There's an explanation _textbox_ in the upper-left, and two _slicers_ to filter the data based on dimension values (year, "theme group").  There are two "summary" _bar chart_ visualizations, showing the magnitude of parts per set and total sets per theme group.  Finally, the centerpiece is a _small-multiples line chart_ visualization, showing both average pieces and number of sets released by year, trellised by the theme group.

Let's tackle visualization-level accessibility first.

We should strive to keep keyboard accessibility as simple as possible; we should only require users to use (Shift-)Tab, Esc, and Enter/Space.  Tab will move focus forward (or backward with the addition of the Shift key) on the current control hierarchy level, Enter/Space will move focus down the hierarchy, and the Escape key will move focus up the hierarchy.  Arrow keys are optional; they would allow users to navigate complex layouts quickly (grids, trees, data points).

![Example visualization control grouping: title, axis ticks, plot area]({{ assetdir }}vis_grouping.png)

In the above example visual (purple) taken from the example Power BI report, both the axis labels (orange) and data bars (green) can be interacted with.  The title (blue) is the heading, explaining the data being displayed, but is not otherwise interactable.  The navigation hierarchy is therefore:

* **Visual** (<span style="font-weight: bold; color: #6600FF;">purple</span>)<br>_Announces: Title (<span style="font-weight: bold; color: #3FA9F5;">blue</span>), Description (alt-text)_<br>_Type: Group_
    * **Plot area** (<span style="font-weight: bold; color: #7AC943;">green</span>)<br>_Announces: "Plot area"_<br>_Type: Group_
        * Data bar #1; _Announces: Item #1 of **n**, **selectable**, followed by all data properties mapped in the visualization_
        * Data bar #2; _Announces: Item #2 of **n**, not selected. Category: Sculptures.  Average parts per set: 2099_
        * ... etc
    * **Axis labels** (<span style="font-weight: bold; color: #FF931E;">orange</span>)<br>_Announces: "Axis labels"_<br>_Type: Group_
        * Axis tick #1; _Announces: Item #1 of **n**, **selectable**, followed by tick text (in this case, category labels)_
        * Axis tick #2; _Announces: Item #2 of **n**, not selected, Sculptures_
        * ... etc

When a user focuses on the visualization, the visual announcement is read out via the screen reader.  The user can then Enter to jump to the first group (<span style="font-weight: bold; color: #7AC943;">Plot area</span>), then can Tab to the second group (<span style="font-weight: bold; color: #FF931E;">Axis labels</span>).  They can then Enter into the axis labels to navigate among the ticks.

If the user then wants to navigate to the plot area, then can hit Esc to pop-out of the Axis labels group and Tab to the Plot area group.  One could imagine that regardless of the complexity of the interactions in the visualization, these groupings would help manage rapid navigation.
I would expect that the primary visual area (in this case, the <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #7AC943;">Plot area</span>) would always be the first group within the visual hierarchy, and that groups are arranged based on the frequency of their usage.

[... obviously a lot more to write]
