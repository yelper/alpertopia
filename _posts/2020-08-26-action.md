This below video is not acceptable on any level for any police department, but the events of the past months have shown that it is emblematic.

I'm not going to be quiet anymore.  I will advocate for change in SPOG's upcoming contract with the city of Seattle.  I will push for officers to be named in OPA/OIG investigations, particularly when an officer already has a sustained finding.  Language in union contracts that prohibit naming officers due to "embarrassment" should be excised.

It is not acceptable to retain citizens as sworn officers in our police departments who have broken public trust multiple times and don't uphold our constitution (e.g., right to peacefully assemble).  Teachers, doctors, transit operators, and nurses that act like this don't get second chances.  I don't believe police officers should be held to a lower standard.
