Unfortunately the [saga of our health status in the last year]({% post_url 2022-03-11-hows-it-going %}) hasn't ended.  While we've recently eschewed the advice we've gotten about "taking it one day at a time" (and I'll get back to that later), it's hard to communicate to others not within our inner circle what kind of year we've had together.

## June – September 2021

Four months into a pregnancy, a routine ultrasound found no natal heartbeat.  A D&E was scheduled shortly after, only one day was taken off.

A follow-up ultrasound (post-pregnancy) identified that a cyst on an ovary had not subsided.  Whereas cysts are relatively common, this was identified for imaging follow-up in three months.

## October – December 2021

Follow-up imaging identified that the cyst was nearly 5cm.  A anthroscopic surgery was scheduled to excise the cyst in early November.

During surgery, the cyst was too involved with the ovary, so standard operating procedure was to also excise the ovary.  During recovery, Amanda suffered an acute case of post-operative pneumonia, which can happen if movement is restricted.  Diagnosis required an overnight visit to urgent care.  Amanda took only two weeks off from school (but really turned into three weeks with Thanksgiving break).

Pathology in late November identified that the cyst was partially cancerous, and triggered a referral to an OB/GYN oncologist at a neighboring hospital.  A "staging" anthroscopic surgery was scheduled for late December, to both remove the appendix (a common place for cancer to sit) and take samples to check for more cancer.  The same incisions were used for the second surgery, only waiting six weeks between the two surgeries (the minimum required time).

## January – March 2022

The pathology report from the staging surgery showed no indication of cancer.  A common escape pathway for ovarian cancer is into the colon, so a combined colonoscopy and endoscopy was scheduled for March.  Amanda took four weeks off in January for surgery recovery.

Both gastroenterology checks were clear in March.  Continued observation of the remaining ovary didn't find anything new.

## April – June 2022

While the OB/GYN oncologist was asked about potential breast cancer in January, Amanda pushed for another opinion in May.  The nurse was concerned enough to trigger a referral to the breast care center, which identified probable cancer to be biospied, where the invasive biospy (think long needle) positively identified.  The geneticist identified it as HER2-, estrogen+ cancer.

There was a full-day of consults in late May to lay out potential treatment plans.  There were choices between a mastectomy (removal of breast) or lumpectomy (surgical removal of tumor), reconstruction or not, radiation or not (dependent on surgery type).  The size and breadth of the tumor was significant enough to push our choice toward mastectomy.

Before surgery, doctors normally perform a CT with a radioisotope to identify the lineage chain of the lymph nodes that are nearby the affected breast.  This helps to identify which lymph nodes should also be biopsied/excised for pathology (did the cancer spread here too?).

However, Amanda was just able to get a bone scan the day before her surgery, which uses a radioisotope dose 25&times; higher than the aforementioned process to identify voids in bones that could be indicative of cancer.  This exposure was significant enough to jeopardize the surgery scheduled for the next day.  After consultation with both heads of their respective departments and a calculation of radioisotope half-lives, it was determined that pushing the mastectomy surgery as late as possible on the next day would be acceptable.  As a result of this oversight, the hospital added a rule to Epic's scheduling parameters to prevent other patients from experiencing this issue again.

Amanda only took three days off for consults in this period, and took off the last two weeks of school off for surgery recovery.

## July – September 2022

Pathology returned that a small number of lymph nodes returned positive for microscopic cancer.  While mastectomy surgery rarely requires radiation, this is one case that requires it.  45 days of radiation were prescribed to begin after 90% patient recovery, and started late July with 15-minute daily appointments.  These appointments were early in the day during the summer, and moved to just after-school once the school year started.

Physical therapy was also started nearly immediately after surgery.

## October – December 2022

Recurring ultrasounds to identify ovarian cysts continued to find no growth.  We went outside the HMO to ask for a second opinion for a summation of the cancers, and received a similar treatment plan.  They also reiterated (the same as HMO) that the two cancers are likely unrelated.

Concerns about residual dizziness were dismissed, but three months of Flonase were prescribed.  When that didn't work (HA!), audiology found no issues and the ENT prescribed an elimination diet (no coffee or tea!).

Eventually, the dizziness precluded Amanda from continuing to work.  Amanda asked for and was granted FMLA leave.
